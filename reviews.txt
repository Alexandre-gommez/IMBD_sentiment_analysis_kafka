Review: Robert Pattinson transitions from a vampire to a batman, proving anyone that can imitate a low raspy voice can be Batman in a costume. As Bruce Wayne, Pattinson was a joke as a brooding goth billionaire who can't afford a good haircut or a comb. He combats the Riddler (Paul Dano) who like Batman is a vigilante wanting to clean up the city, corruption that leads back to Wayne's parents. BTW What was his mother's secret that caused everything? ZoÃ« Kravitz did an excellent Catwoman and was every bit as good as Halle Berry's Razzy performance. Colin Farrell was not recognizable as the Penguin, who was on the good-bad line. Gollum (Andy Serkis) as Alfred was simply bad casting. I kept waiting for him to say his master was a trickster.In spite of the downfalls, the script, action, and mystery held my interest. Riddler reminded me of Anonymous and would have been better in a Guy Fawkes mask. The climax was not overly exciting and I am not sure why everyone in the city had to be punished.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.

Review: I'll admit I raised an eyebrow when I saw that Pattinson was cast, but I eat my words, he was awesome, and hopefully will play the part a few more times.This film blew me away, exciting, fast paced, surprisingly gritty, and genuinely had an awesome story.The franchise somehow felt renewed here, even if you're not a fan of superhero movies, you will love this.Andy Serkis was genuinely awesome, but when isn't he? The acting throughout was fantastic, with plenty of well known faces.Great music, great special effects, I've already booked to see it again.10/10.

Review: I assume there are still people out there that cannot stand Robert Pattinson. This dislike was born when he accepted one of the main roles in the Twilight universe. If you are one of those, I do not think I will be able to sway you - to convince you otherwise. I could tell you, that he has proven himself as an actor in many films since then. And when I say that I am not trying to put the Twilight Saga down. I was not the target audience of that - still I saw some interesting things in there, but also things that I did not like at all.But this is about ... The Batman! A distinction in the title - maybe to be able to find it better when browsing or looking for it. Because and I'm sure you are aware of that: there are many other movies called Batman. Actually before Marvel took over the reigns, DC was the one producing good comic book movies. Superman and Batman being the most noteable ones. No one back then thought of combining the heroes though. Everyone stayed in their lane. Something this movie does too. And maybe it is better if DC does not emulate or copy the MCU formula ... I understand that it is more than tempting considering all the money that is involved of course.All that history aside, this as I already said, is a standalone movie. This is about The Batman! And while you may have your favorite (Keaton, West or Bale - though maybe even Affleck or the unlikely choice of Kilmer or Clooney), do not condemn the Patts just yet. He really transforms and gets into the role ... a role that anyone should consider an honor to play.I am overall a MCU fan boy as some may call me. But I have a deep love for the Bats. And while that makes me at least somewhat biased, this is not the reason I am surprised the movie has such a high rating. I am surprised because the movie is long (even if you don't really feel it - even when you may think at times "alright we have spent quite a lot of time lingering haven't we?") and because it is quite dark ... pun intended. The tone and the overall lighting of the movie.There is violence here - things that a decade or so ago, you may not have been able to get away with and still get a PG13 rating. Bashing of the head with a blunt object? Yes you don't get close ups and there is not as much blood to be seen as with other movies that also have head bashings - but just the thought and certain glimpses we get to see ... is more than enough.But all that and the fact this is a detective story ... really help elevate the movie. That and a strong cast of people. I thought Jared Leto had one of the greatest transformations for House of Gucci ... but Colin Farrell actually isn't recognizable in this. And would also fit in the House of Gucci, considering the italian accent/New York slang he uses.The darkness and the shadows play a big role. And you may find yourself looking to find something in them ... even something (or someone?) that doesn't exist/is there. The action scenes are really well played out - there is even one that reminisces that feeling you may have had playing a game or two with the Batman. Arkham City may arguably be the best game of the series - with a fighting system that really is extraordinary. Many have tried to copy it - but I never felt that seemless flow in anything else I've played since then.And then there is the sound system ... I watched it in Imax too, though it doesn't seem to have been filmed with an Imax camera. Still bigger screen so all good. But the sound ... wow! Just wow - incredible.So while I still feel that The Dark Knight is a bit better - this comes as close as they get. Coincidences and convenient timing aside. Because a lot of things have to go right (or wrong depending on your perspective) for the movie and the story to work ... still small and minor "flaws" like that aside - because that should not stop you from enjoying this very well made movie.Edit: Since this is not an origin story, but still the beginnings of Batman, he is not invincible and he may not have every gimmick/toy/car/vehicle you may expect him to have. There is one truly great car chase though ... I personally would not compare it to the real great ones you may have seen (Bullit, French Connection and so forth) and just see it as a thing that works on its own. Also the added bonus - after credits "scene" - is really not something that many will think worthwhile ... as in worth staying and watching the credits through to get this ... well let's call it easter egg, that is not really a scene, but a callback to a scene from earlier ... with a promise for the future one may say. Still you can google it and it probably will have the same effect as if you watched it "unfold".

Review: This film delivers a much darker and more sinister Batman, quite unlike the many versions that have gone before. The representation of Gotham as well, is steeped in corruption and decay. The story opens with the death of the city's mayor, and from there introduces the principal characters that are part of the Batman legacy that are known all too well by fans. In tone, I think this film was more like the "Gotham" cable series than any of the prior movies, even if that show had more to do with the young Bruce Wayne growing into the masked crime fighter. The villains both in "Gotham" and in this story personified the evil and malice that gripped Batman's hometown, with an added element of corruption in the background of Bruce Wayne's father that put him under the thumb of crime boss Carmine Falcone (John Turturro).All of the performances here were exceptional. Robert Pattinson's take on Batman was more effective than his portrayal of Bruce Wayne, who looked like he was part of the grunge scene. I didn't much care for the Batman outfit, it looked unusually heavy and clunky; one's first inkling that Batman was arriving was heralded by the thumping footsteps one might associate with "Jurassic Park". Pattinson's voice as Batman, as well as those of Lieutenant Gordon (Jeffrey Wright) and The Riddler (Paul Dano) sounded like they were coming through a synthesizer. It made for dramatic effect, although not quite realistic.This film version of The Riddler is not like anything you've seen before or would have expected. His off-screen portrayals hinted at a demented masked vigilante, which made the actual appearance of the character that much more compelling when it revealed an almost baby faced Dano in the role of a psychotic madman. Quite honestly, it wasn't until the credits rolled that I became aware that Colin Farrell had the role of Oz, hidden underneath all the prosthetics and make-up. Yes, he was referred to as The Penguin, but it wasn't overdone, and his full name (Oswald Cobblepot) was never mentioned.Rounding out the principals was Zoe Kravitz as the slinky Catwoman, Selina Kyle. She had some major kick butt action in the film, and rose to the occasion to save Batman's near the end of the story. Speaking of which, even with his seemingly armor plated outfit, Batman appeared unusually vulnerable to attacks by his foes in the picture. It marked him as more human than the average super-hero with unusual powers.I will say this, your attention needs to be focused due to the nuances that are revealed in the telling of Bruce Wayne's parents' story and how he might have been misled growing up. His father's relationship with Falcone and fellow mob boss Salvatore Moroni bear on Gotham's reputation. Maybe it was inadvertent, but there might have been a subliminal tribute to the "Gotham" series here with the character of Falcone associate Kenzie (Peter McDonald). The role of James Gordon in that series was portrayed by Ben McKenzie.

Review: I will be honest and say that I had mixed opinions of another Batman movie, especially when I heard of the casting of the lead star of the Twilight films, but as time went by and saw more images and clips, I was more up for it, directed by Matt Reeves (Cloverfield, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes). Basically, on Halloween, Gotham City mayor Don Mitchell Jr. (Rupert Penry-Jones) is murdered by a man calling himself the Riddler. The Batman, aka billionaire Bruce Wayne (Robert Pattinson), has been operating as a masked vigilante for two years, he investigates alongside the Gotham City Police Department. A message is left addressed to The Batman by the Riddler, but Commissioner Pete Savage (EastEnders' Alex Ferns) berates Lieutenant James Gordon (Jeffrey Wright) for allowing a vigilante to enter the crime scene and forces Batman to leave. Soon after, the Riddler kills Savage and leaves another message for Batman. Batman and Gordon discover that the Riddler left a USB drive in Mitchell's car containing images of Mitchell with a woman, Annika Koslov (Hana Hrzic). They were photographed outside the Iceberg Lounge, a nightclub operated by Oswald "Oz" Cobblepot, better known as the Penguin (Colin Farrell), the chief lieutenant of mobster Carmine Falcone (John Turturro). Batman questions the Penguin who claims not to know anything but working at the club as a waitress is Annika's roommate, Selina Kyle (ZoÃ« Kravitz). Batman follows Selina home to question Annika, but she disappears, so he sends Selina back to the Iceberg Lounge to search for answers. With Selina using an eyepiece with a camera face recognition technology, Batman discovers that Savage was on Falcone's payroll, and so is District Attorney Gil Colson (Peter Sarsgaard). Selina takes out the eyepiece, cutting communication with Batman, when he presses her about her relationship with Falcone. The Riddler abducts Colson, strapping a collar bomb and timer to his neck, and sends him to interrupt Mitchell's funeral. When Batman arrives, the Riddler (Paul Dano) video calls him on Colson's phone and threatens to detonate the bomb if Colson cannot answer three riddles. Batman helps Colson answer the first two, but Colson refuses to answer the third, to name the informant who leaked information to the GCPD leading to a historic drug bust ending mobster the operations of mobster Sal Maroni, so the bomb is exploded and Colson dies. Batman and Gordon deduce that the informant may be the Penguin and track him to a drug deal. They discover that Maroni's operation transferred to Falcone, with many GCPD officers involved. Selina inadvertently exposes them when she arrives to steal money. As the Penguin flees, Selina discovers Annika's dead body in a car trunk. After a chase through the city, Batman captures the Penguin but learns that he was not the informant. Batman and Gordon follow the Riddler's trail to the ruins of an orphanage funded by Bruce Wayne's murdered parents, Thomas (Luke Roberts) and Martha (Stella Stocker). There they learn that the Riddler holds a grudge against the Wayne family. Bruce's butler and caretaker, Alfred Pennyworth (Andy Serkis), is hospitalised after opening a letter addressed to Bruce, containing a bomb that explodes. Then the Riddler leaks evidence that Thomas Wayne, who was running for mayor before he was murdered, hired Falcone to kill a journalist for threatening to reveal details about Martha's embarrassing history of mental illness. Bruce, who grew up believing his father was a good man, confronts Alfred, who confirms the allegations but maintains that Thomas only wanted Falcone to threaten the journalist to keep quiet, and planned to turn Falcone over to the police once he found out the journalist was murdered. Alfred believes that Falcone had Thomas and Martha killed to prevent this. Selina tells Batman that Falcone is her father, but Falcone is unaware of this. She learns that Falcone strangled Annika because Mitchell told her that Falcone was the informant and decides to kill him. Batman and Gordon arrive at the Iceberg Lounge in time to stop her, but the Riddler kills Falcone as he is arrested. The Riddler is unmasked as forensic accountant Edward Nashton and incarcerated in Arkham State Hospital (Arkham Asylum). Unaware that Batman is Bruce Wayne, he talks about failing to kill Bruce, who he idolises and took inspiration from when targeting the corrupt. Nashton proposes a partnership, but Batman rejects him. Searching Nashton's apartment, Batman learns that he has planted car bombs around Gotham City and has gained an online following with the goal being to assassinate mayor-elect Bella ReÃ¡l (Jayme Lawson). They are all detonated and destroy the breakwaters around Gotham, causing the city to flood. A shelter is set up in an indoor arena, where Nashton's followers shoot at ReÃ¡l. The assassination fails however with Batman and Selina, as Catwoman, fighting them off. In the aftermath, Nashton befriends an unseen Arkham inmate (Barry Keoghan), most likely the Joker, and they laugh together. Meanwhile, Selina deems Gotham beyond saving and leaves. Batman aids recovery efforts and vows to inspire hope in Gotham. Also starring Gil Perez-Abraham as Officer Martinez, Peter McDonald as Kenzie, Con O'Neill as Chief Mackenzie Bock, Oscar Novak as Young Bruce Wayne, Joseph Walker as Young Riddler, Sandra Dickinson as Dory, and Jack Bennett as Travis. Pattison gives a suitably moody and dynamic as the Caped Crusader, with very few scenes of him out of the suit (which is a good thing), Dano is great at being the menacing and maniacal villain, Kravitz does well as the street-savvy cat burglar (hence Catwoman), Farrell is utterly unrecognisable under the prosthetics and gets some one-liners, and there is good support from Wright as the honest cop and Serkis as the hero's mentor. The making and release of the film was delayed a few times by COVID-19, including Pattison catching the virus; it was odd to see it rated 15, but the violence, threat and swearing make it so, and the three-hour length is a bit much, but besides that, it worked out nicely. It is completely different to past Batman movies, with much more emphasis on being like a detective story, you go along with the Hitchcockian style serial killer mystery, following the clues, it has a terrifically dark noirish tone, and there a few explosive pyrotechnical chases and fights to keep fans happy, an intriguing and watchable superhero action thriller. Very good!

Review: We are now on "The Batman." I suppose such a title is to distinguish it from plain ol' "Batman." Like the football players who are from "The" Ohio State University or "The" University of Miami as though there are impostors of those same schools out there that they have to distinguish themselves from.Robert Pattinson plays Batman, and while his Batman is adequate, his Bruce Wayne was underwhelming. His Batman seemed to have fewer gadgets, but he did at least make his suit bulletproof. His Bruce Wayne was barely shown, and when he was it was as if he carried the pain and anger of Batman with him. All other Bruce Wayne's were able to turn on the charm when in public, this Bruce Wayne has the "life sucks" face."The Batman" opted to be more of a murder mystery than an action flick. There was action (even a scene involving the Penguin in which the audience applauded), but nothing like Batmans past.A glasses-wearing masked man was committing a string of murders. He was killing high profile members of Gotham and leaving cyphers for Batman to figure out. The movie doesn't hide that the killer is the Riddler, while it does hide his true identity. The Riddler was circuitously directing Batman and others to a particular criminal he wanted outed. Batman and Lt. James Gordon (Jeffrey Wright) suspected that the Riddler's final target was either The Penguin (Colin Farrell) or Carmine Falcone (John Turturro). Whether or not it's either of them is saved for close to the end.Speaking of the end, this movie was nearly three hours long, and I began to feel it. There was a point that the movie could've wrapped up, and I thought it was, then it dragged on for another half-hour or so. I was happy to be in the theater watching a movie, but not that happy. A two hour movie would've been just as satisfying. After watching all of the previews it made the movie-going experience well over three hours.How does this Batman stack up against the others? OK. It's no "Dark Knight," but it is also far from "Batman Forever" or "Batman & Robin."Free with Cinemark Movie Club membership.

Review: The Riddler(Paul Dano, spot-on. How did it take this long for him to get a role like this?) targets public officials, revealing their corruption, and killing them in gruesome fashion(how did this get away with a PG-13 again? Oh, right, as long as you don't show the details, then you can get away with almost anything, by now. Even a barely toned down Jigsaw). In order to stop him, it will be necessary for the Bat and the Cat(with amazing chemistry), together, to stop the rat. Thanks, Matt.I really did not think that we needed yet another film dealing with Bruce Wayne's alter-ego. How about Nightwing? I know it's not likely, but part of me still holds out hope that Grayson will be turned into a feature(if you've never checked out the trailer on YouTube, you're missing out). But somehow, this managed to convince me. Fingers crossed for at least one sequel. Robert Pattinson is incredible here. Seriously, can we just stop freaking out every time the role is recast? The closest we've come to someone who shouldn't be doing it is George Clooney, and it's not like anybody came out of that flick looking good. He took that job after doing From Dusk till Dawn. There was good reason to think that he was going to be badass. Honestly, everyone here gives a strong performance.Something that will definitely appeal to some more than others, is the genre and tone. This is essentially Se7en meets Zodiac. It is not paced like a typical massive blockbuster. While the action is great, especially the martial arts, not to mention that car chase, there's less of it and it is smaller scale than for example the Nolan trilogy(which also has far more escalation). Essentially, this just isn't focused that much on that aspect of the titular icon. And I think we can all agree that we've had some great entries that deliver that. This is more interested in conveying to the audience that there's a reason he's called the world's greatest detective. We've barely seen it outside of the animated ones before, so I'm very happy with that choice by them.In addition to what I've already mentioned, this features some drugs, suggestive material and strong language. I recommend this to any fan of Batman. 9/10.

Review: Batman helps Lieutenant James Gordon investigate a series of murders of prominent citizens, each of which is accompanied by a cryptic puzzle. Tendrils snake into the underworld and into previously ususpected areas of darkness in Bruce Wayne's personal history.Matt Reeves' 3-hour epic reboot of the caped crusader hits cinema screens, and it is unlike any previous version. In truth, I was ready to dislike it - not because of any great loyalty to any previous iteration, just 'cuz - but it's not bad. It's not great, and it takes itself far too seriously, but it's good.We discover immediately that this Batman is a brutal brawler, but we then find out that he is an able detective, working with quasi-approval from the GCPD. Bruce Wayne is a bit of an emo goth, which didn't quite work for me, but Robert Pattinson is a covincing Batman, brooding and understated. Paul Dano also impressed.I have quibbles. One. My late father used to bemoan the tendency for modern movies to be dark: he would have HATED this. I have never seen such a dark film. Two. The wonderful Michael Giacchino has lifted the musical motif for Batman straight from Darth Vader's theme, which was both naughty and distracting. Three. It is possible to drop in a bit of light relief here and there, y'know. Just a bit. In three hours.Not bad, though.

Review: THE BATMAN (2022) *** Robert Pattinson, Zoe Kravitz, Jeffrey Wright, Colin Farrell, Paul Dano, John Turturro, Andy Serkis, Peter Sarsgaard. Filmmaker Matt Reeves pulls out all the stops in this even darker adaptation of the Bob Kane comic book hero with Pattinson standing tall and brooding as Bruce Wayne employing vigilante style justice as The Caped Cursader while Gotham quakes under the siege of the homicidal Riddler (Dano affectively disturbing) and gaining an unlikely ally in Selina Kyle (ass-kicking Kravitz in pre-Catwoman mode). Arresting visuals thanks in large part to ace cinematography by Greig Fraser and James Chinlund's production design all aided by the foreboding score by Michael Giacchino full of bombast and dread. Farrell, under a ton of unrecognizable prosthetics, has a field day in getting in touch with his inner Robert De Niro as The Penguin. By all means see it in IMAX!

Review: Greetings again from the darkness. Riddle me this: does "The Bat, The Cat, and The Rat" sound more like an opening line to a joke or the title of a Dr. Seuss book? In fact, those are three core elements of this new, COVID-delayed, and highly anticipated film from writer-director Matt Reeves and co-writer Peter Craig. I'll confess to being a huge fan of Christopher Nolan's 'Dark Knight' trilogy (that concluded 10 years ago), and being a bit skeptical to a new version featuring Robert Pattinson in the titular role (I'm choosing to totally ignore the in-between portrayals in the "Justice League" movies). Knowing full well how important it is for fans to watch these films with fresh eyes and a clear head, this review is purposefully vague on what will surely prove to be some of the more popular and contentious discussion points.Let's start with a general description and the setup. The film is dark and gloomy and gritty and grimy. Gotham is a cesspool of corruption and crime, and we get no glimpse into the other side, assuming there is one. Billionaire Bruce Wayne (Robert Pattinson) is still in his second year as the Batman, often referred to as "Vengeance". There is substantial backstory for Mr. Wayne, who lives in relative seclusion with his trusty manservant Alfred Pennyworth (Andy Serkis), while the Batman prowls at night in his efforts to clean up the city. Of course he is unable to keep pace with crime and corruption, even with the close alliance he has built with good cop, Police Lt. James Gordon (Jeffrey Wright). It takes Batman's Poirot-like detective skills to solve a riddle left as a clue in a particularly high-profile murder case. Soon it's obvious a serial killer is at work and he has purposefully drawn the Batman into his game.The caped crusader proceeds to cross paths with Selena Kyle/Catwoman (a terrific Zoe Kravitz), Oswald Cobblepot/Penguin (an unrecognizable Colin Farrell), District Attorney Gil Golson (Peter Sarsgaard), and crime lord Carmine Falcone (John Turturro). As city VIPs begin showing up dead, it's a masked Edward Nashton/Riddler (Paul Dano) who always seems a step ahead. All of the above receive their chance to shine on screen, and while none let us down, it's not until the mask is ripped from Riddler, and Dano really shines, that we are left wanting more. It should be noted that Farrell (with his facial prosthetics and fat suit) is kind of a second fiddle here, but it's surely intentional and meant to set the stage for more Penguin antics down the road.Pattinson will certainly receive the most scrutiny. I found him to be an excellent Batman, with black eye makeup smeared by sweat under his cowl, maintaining the grungy tone. His whispery voice differs from Christian Bale's gravely growl, but works for the character's withdrawn nature and preference for detective work over than fighting. Staying true to the premise that this is only his second year, there is a significant shortage of "wonderful toys", and the batmobile is less rocket ship and more souped-up coupe. The contrast to these is a batsuit that seems quite advanced (and looks cool). It's Pattinson's Bruce Wayne that didn't work for me. I respect the reclusive billionaire aspect, but he mostly looks like someone on their way to a Nirvana gig, leaving us wondering how the heck could anyone not connect the dots between a creepy rich guy and a nearly identical creepy guy in a bat suit. It's a minor complaint, but one that stuck with me.Oscar-winning composer Michael Giacchino (UP, 2009) takes a more classical approach than the dramatics of predecessors Hans Zimmer and Danny Elfman. Giacchino has been a frequent Pixar contributor, and scored some well-known blockbusters in franchises like 'Jurassic World', 'Star Trek', 'Planet of the Apes', 'Mission Impossible', 'Spider-man', and 'Star Wars'. His work fits nicely here. Adapting characters and stories originated by Bob Kane and Bill Finger, Matt Reeves and Peter Craig have found a way to put their own stamp on the work. Mr. Craig is Oscar winner Sally Field's son, and his previous scripts include THE TOWN (2010), parts 1 and 2 of THE HUNGER GAMES: MOCKINGJAY, and upcoming high-profile projects in TOP GUN: MAVERICK and GLADIATOR 2. Director Reeves has previously helmed the excellent horror film LET ME IN (2010), as well as DAWN OF THE PLANET OF THE APES (2014) and WAR FOR THE PLANET OF THE APES (2017).This marks the first in a planned Batman trilogy, and a couple of the last scenes seemingly set the stage for what's to come. Although this is an odd movie, here's hoping the franchise maintains this tone and avoids the typical Marvel/DC overblown CGI approach. After all, the Batman is but one man, not a God of superpowers. This film is an unusual blend of noir-horror-detective-action-psychological thriller wrapped in a gray box with a black bow, and though it will likely be divisive among fans (isn't everything?), this 3-hour epic leaves us anticipating the next 'bat time' and 'bat channel'.Opens wide in theaters on March 4, 2022.

Review: Batman has had lots of movies through the years and he did a bit of detective work, but not much. So this movie obviously wanted to showcase this ability of The Batman and it does so very well having a very good set of villains as this Riddler is much more what I am used to in the comics, the Penguin is not some mutated dude raised by penguins and corruption is the key to everything. We get a new Batman in Robert Pattison and he does a very good job, more dark and brooding and without all the growling and shouting of Bale's. The movie is dark and just very interesting as it truly had me wondering who and what was the endgame. However, there is action, so do not let people try to say that the film is absent of some good old punching!The story, key political figures are being dispatched, first it is the mayor. The person responsible leaves chilling riddles behind and seems to be taking an interest in Batman who is already Batman so no origin story here. Batman is already working with Gordon and looks over the crime scene. Soon things start to point to this person or that and even Bruce's father may have a part in it as the Riddler's game turns out to be even more heinous than even Batman could guess!Pattison was very good as Batman, he was not super muscular like the Batman in the comics, but really the only guy who pumped up for the role was Ben Affleck's Batman. I would put Robert in a tie with Bale in second as they both look fit, but not really jacked up. Colin is great as the Penguin and I was totally surprised to find Andy Serkis was Alfred. I kept thinking I know him from somewhere, but I guess I just did not think of the actor as old enough to be Alfred. Zoe Kravitz is a rather good Catwoman, not quite Michelle's but better than the one from Rising. The Batmobile I rather liked, like the Batmobile fused with Mad Max's vehicle!So, this film was good, I would say it is my fave Batman, but one always tends to fall in love with something when they see it for the first time, so I'll hold judgement. I am very curious to see where this is going and if they team up who I think they are going to team up, that would be really cool. I definitely think Robert can do the job, was not a fan of Twilight, but come on, everyone has to get their start somewhere, and he was so dark in this film, most will forget that he ever sparkled.

Review: Well Rob Pattinson is no Christine Bale and it was smart that Pattinson did a different version for The Batman. There was no Christine Bale the playboy millionaire character side of Batman which made the movie less fun. Regrettably, there was not much humor in The Batman, but The Batman took a much darker serious role! Thankful, that woke Hollywood did not ruin another Super hero movie with forcing the current woke flavor characters, or storyline, which creates another disjointed and boring film. Hollywood did not create another formulated good guy meets bad guy with super power duel ending either. The Batman is sorta anti woke. Themes like everyone is not what people formulate them as. Batman is not the only one with dark secrets. Even the most noble have burred mistakes and pasts. The truth is mixed with lies and what we want to believe. The themes create sub stories which slowly unravel and keep the enthralled in what will be revealed next. The Batman character is built up rage, which turns dark. The Batman/Wayne character and story meld into one, while every character think that they are the true victim and Wayne had it easy. The plot twist, I never saw coming, was the Riddler is just a angry tech guy, very human, delusional, and frail. I will not call this the best Batman, but compared to todays trash superhero movie The Batman is a solid movie. 8 stars.

Review: Always been a "Batman" fan as the D. C. legend is my favorite superhero and watching all of the movies from the classic 1989 one, every so often the fans see that the series changes tone and feel as it's rebooted. "The Batman" directed by Matt Reeves is a dark take with conflict as "Batman" deals with a city underworld of secrets, while serial killings are happening, and the hope and chance for romance struts right in front of him.Gotham has a serial killer on the loose and with each victim found strange puzzle like word clues are left, as "Batman" investigates the mystery and things become complex as it's all tied into a world of city officials and underworld crime figures are connected to them. Plus secrets come up as "Batman" himself is wrapped up into this wicked game.The film chemistry and cast of characters are top notch with young star Robert Pattinson filling out the bat suit just fine and Zoe Kravitz is raw and outspoken as Selina Kyle a slash friend and foe love interest of the bat. Colin Farrell was well made up as the Penguin thru it all combined with fire blazing action and kick butt punches "The Batman" is a compelling drama with suspense and revealing secrets of Gotham city officials as crime boss Carmine Falcone is a lead figure to all of this."The Batman" is in depth and dark a new reboot style take on the D. C legend as it's a good film still not the best, still if a "Batman" and D. C. fan you will enjoy as the film rubs off a feel from many of the graphic novels, as to get more understanding read "The Dark Knight Returns" or "The Long Halloween".

Review: "It's a big city. I can't be everywhere." Batman (Rob Pattison) A more complete adaptation of the Batman comics presence there isn't, and no more gothic, spot-on condemnation of human frailty since the 50-year-old Godfather. Writer/director Matt Reeves' The Batman is arguably the definitive dark night of the American soul in its corruption and its salvation. As an achievement of robust American neo noir, it ranks somewhere behind Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver and Godfather.Batman (Rob Pattinson) scowls as if he came from a Twilight frame of mind while he shows a soft side in his love for Selena Kyle/Cat Woman (Zoe Kravitz), the Bat and the Cat, working to save the city from the likes of Riddler (Paul Dano), Penguin (Colin Farrell), and crime lord Carmine Falcone (John Turturro). Besides offing a large number of corrupt city employees, they offer Bruce Wayne a chance to learn about his obsession with his parents' public and private lives and their untimely deaths. Although none of the bad boys eclipses the impact of Heath Ledger's multidimensional Joker, even in his humor, together they are a powerful cast of darkness.Besides bringing together an ensemble of estimable actors in every role, Reeves gathers expert cinematographer Greig Fraser and production designer James Chinlund to create a darkness full of telling images while competing with the great film noir compositions of all time. Dark, yes, obscure, no. The darkness that envelopes each scene says more about the bleak side of humanity than any written treatise could.Besides the corruption of city officials, The Batman casts a shadow over the virtue of vengeance, embodied in Wayne's longing to account for the death of his parents and bad-boys like Riddler to assuage the pain of his childhood by terrorizing the city. In his favor, Riddler is ridding the city of corrupt power while Batman is cleaning it of its petty criminals. His stalwart ally, Lt. James Gordon (Jeffrey Wright), realizes that the real crimes are housed in his police force and ultimately his supervisors.The Batman is a hip and incisive representation of modern angst that not even a hero can relieve, at least not right now:To the strains of Nirvana's baleful Something In The Way: "They think I'm hiding in the shadows, but I AM the shadows." Batman.

Review: The headline can be taken two ways. If you remove any hype or expectations, saying it's a good movie is positive. But if you are hoping for an amazing new Batman iteration, good means it wasn't great, let alone amazing.This review will come off as negative but I did enjoy it. I love the tone. It's super dark and grounded in reality, even more than the Nolan trilogy. And it feels true to the character. Zoe Kravitz and Jeffrey Wright are great casting choices. It's a mostly well-made film and a good addition to the franchise. And the Bat suit looks awesome.At the same time, nothing about this movie wowed me. I did not connect with the characters, especially the villain. The relationships seem undeveloped and not organic. I was not nearly as emotionally invested in the story as I should have been. It mostly feels surface level.If you're a huge Batman fan, I think you will really enjoy it. But as a movie, I don't think it fires on all cylinders. The Nolan trilogy still reigns supreme.

Review: Thank goodness this was good. I made my top ten Batman movies list yesterday and realized I've only seen 10 Batman-starring films so that means...Batman & Robin made the cut. Should that EVER be in a top ten?And yes, The Batman was good. Great, nope but a solid movie that's 90% detective and 10% action. I will say this new Batman-look IS great as is the soundtrack and the amount of actual Batman in the film vs. Just Bruce Wayne. But, no. Robert Pattinson still CANNOT act to save his life. Thanks to Val Kilmer and George Clooney, he's certainly not the worst Bruce/Batman.I can see why this movie's 3-hours long, though 30+ minutes could've EASILY been cut to make this much tighter and a better repeat-watchability. Because, as of now, I really don't ever plan on seeing this again and I even saw Batman & Robin a few times.It's 3-hours long because of the most complicated plot and since they made Bats SOOO much more human in this incarnation, it REALLY takes Batman a VERY long time to figure out the mystery. I will give another praise for how many mistakes he makes and how he's learning. I did like that, but still would've preferred him getting to the core of the plot a lot quicker.It's Batman: Year Two and he's dealing with an incredibly smart villain while working with another vengeance-seeking ally and while he's jumping through one hoop after another, more and more chaos is escalating.Really don't have much negative to say about this other than the length and how both the villain and Bruce are really not that interesting. Luckily, and as stated above, Robert's in the Batsuit for a grand majority of the movie and I really dug that. He looked GREAT as the Bat and while the movie's pretty dark (like way too dark, despite the theme,) they really did make good use of his silhouette and surroundings.I will give kudos to ZoÃ« Kravitz. She was absolutely the best actor in the movie and best character to boot. Where was she when they previously hired Halle Berry?If you choose to see this in theatres, make sure you see it with Dolby surround sound as that was awesome in this. And once I found out there isn't actual end credit and found out what's posted at the end, I left during the credits.I. E. Once the credits roll in the end, just leave. You've already sacrificed 3 hours, save some time left at the end that's not worth your time. Just Google it to learn the "secret" message.***Final Thoughts: Here's the updated Best Batman Movies (that I've seen):1. Batman 2. The Dark Knight 3. Batman Returns 4. Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (Ultimate Edition) 5. Batman Begins 6. The Lego Batman Movie 7. The Batman 8. Batman: Mask of the Phantasm 9. The Dark Knight Rises 10. Batman Forever.

Review: The Batman creates a grim & gloomy atmosphere, and it moves along so slowly that you could almost fall asleep to it. However, if you did, you'd probably have nightmares. This movie made me believe that Robert Pattison could be Batman, although I'm not entirely sold on him as Bruce Wayne. Paul Dano is disturbingly demented in his role as the Riddler, and Colin Farrell is absolutely unrecognizable as the Penguin. I liked this new take on Batman, but I didn't love it.

Review: I liked the movie. There were some ridiculous scenes in the movie, but overall I liked the movie. I watched the movie in Baku (Azerbaijan) 28 Mall, Cinema Plus and the movie theater was good. There was no problem on screen, light and sound. The movie was long, it could have been a little short because the endings of the movie were a bit boring. Music and specially the main score was good. The acting was great, Robert Pattison, Zoe Kravitz, Paul Dano, Colin Farrell, Jeffrey Wright, John Turturo all did well. I was happy when I heard that Robert Pattion will be the Batman, because he is such a good actor. Please forget about the "vampire" thing. Matt Reeves did a great job. Gotham City was great. Bruce Wayne turned out to be exactly what I wanted.I really liked this movie.I did not like Alfred.In my opinion Best Batman, not best Bruce Wayne, not Best Batman movie but overall very good movie.

Review: Greetings from Lithuania."The Batman" (2022) for me personally was not as entertaining as Christopher Nolan's take in "The Dark Knight" trilogy. If i would compare this movie to Nolan's series, it would be more close to "The Dark Knight". That said i liked "The Batman" for its being very faithful adaptation of Batman universe itself. I saw two or three DC' animated Batman movies and this film was more in common with those then any other Batman movie ever made."The Batman" (2022) is a very dark movie, and i mean that in every way. In a whole 3 hours running time there is basically scene or two set in day time. And 98% of the film is set during night, and looks like in Gotham it is always raining. It is a very gritty and down to earth setting, and that i liked about it. The atmosphere of this movie highly reminded me of "Se7en" (1995). Performances were good and Robert Pattinson was a superb as Batman. Yet i think it was ZoÃ« Kravitz who stole the show.Overall, "The Batman" (2022) is a dark, gritty and very down to earth adaptation of Batman. For younger audiences who grew up on watching Marvel movies (no offence - i really enjoy them as well) this adaptation of Batman will be a test of patience - this movie is not for everyone and reminded me of "Joker" (2019) more then any other comic book movie. In its running time 3 hours this movie did drag here and there, but as a whole package it really worth seeing. Not my favorite Batman movie, but a solid one.

Review: "The Batman" is an Action - Drama movie in which we watch Batman trying to protect the citizens of Gotham from the Riddler, a sadistic serial killer who murders some politicians of the city.I have to admit that I did not have high expectations from this movie but I happily surprised by it. It was different than the previous Batman movies, a bit darker and the action scenes were also captured from a different aspect. The plot of the movie was interesting and contained plenty of suspense but it also contained some very slow scenes that they could be sorter. The interpretation of Robert Pattinson who played as Bruce Wayne was good and he made the difference. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were ZoÃ« Kravitz's who played as Selina Kyle, Jeffrey Wright's who played as Lt. James Gordon, Andy Serkis' who played as Alfred and Paul Dano's who played as The Riddler. Finally, I have to say that "The Batman" is a nice action movie and I highly recommend everyone to watch it.

Review: The Batman (2022) is a movie my wife and I caught an advanced screening of last night. The storyline follows Gotham shortly after "The Batman" has emerged and established himself in the streets. A serial killer known as The Riddler starts a killing spree of everyone influential within Gotham's hierarchy until Bruce Wayne in inevitably the target. How are all of these people tied together and can Batman tie the pieces together before Wayne is the next victim?This movie is directed by Matt Reeves (Cloverfield) and stars Robert Pattinson (Twilight), ZoÃ« Kravitz (Kimi), Colin Farrell (Total Recall), Paul Dano (There Will be Blood), John Turturro (Do the Right Thing), Peter Sarsgaard (Garden State), Andy Serkis (Lord of the Rings), Jeffrey Wright (Shaft) and Barry Keoghan (Eternals).The storyline, look and feel of this movie is an A+. The characters are perfectly cast and well executed. Farrell, Dano and Kravitz were a 10/10.This movie does a fantastic job of depicting the Batman universe with the appropriate grit and feel and the lighting and cinematography is excellent. This also did a good job of creating various potential spinoffs with some subtle references within the storyline and at the end. This has a very good Jeph Loeb comics feel to it and does a good job delivering the "Detective" elements of Batman. The violence was also brilliant and very well done. I will say this did not need to be 3-hours and there are an abundance of scenes that could have been better edited. This film likely should have been a hair under 2 and a half hours.Overall this is a magnificent addition to the super hero genre and an absolute must see for Batman fans. I would score this a 7.5- 8/10 and strongly recommend it.

Review: The darkest Batman adaptation even the first one with a f bomb! Beautifully filmed with the amazing writing and oh man Paul Dano was masterful as Riddler and I think Robert Pattinson was one of the best Batman's! Only minor thing to budge through is the length even that was worth it all the through especially the IMAX format made everything better.I was a little annoyed someone got their seat late and wanted me and my sister to move down even though I had my ticket for a few weeks that was ridiculous they were lucky I didn't feel like saying much cause I'm to nice for my own good; not only that stuff a family thought Ben Affleck's Batman was better hell to the no! Anyway I love how ratings are close to Dark Knight, The Batman deserves so much praise.

Review: I just got out of The BatmanThis movie really won't be for everyone!! Easily the darkest Batman movie yet. It is gritty, depressing and not a fun movie at all.This isn't your usual comic book movie, it's a detective movie, with more in common with Se7en, than previous Batman movies. The first two thirds of the movie are amazing, at one point I turned to my son and said "This is a masterpiece" everything works and is brilliant, I was 100% enthralled, but boy does it drop the ball in the final act.Of the cast Pattinson is great, Collin Farrell is ok, Zoe Kravitz was fine too, but she has zero chemistry with Pattinson (Keaton and Pfeiffer they are not), Paul Dano though, was incredible, especially in the scene in Arkham, whilst Geoffrey Wright is as great as he always is.On the downside, It does have some pacing issues, and is really too long (though I'm not sure what I'd cut), and I really wasn't keen on the ending (I don't know if it is a comic book storyline they did), as I think the final act really lets the movie down!! It's here, in the final act, that you feel the movies run time!!I was surprised there were only 36 other people in my screening.

Review: So nice to see that it is still possible to make a blockbuster action movie that really has got COJONES.The good: the acting performances are TOP. They really are. And acting is what matters firstmost. The many different characters are true to life, however weird this story might be, I still DO BELIEVE in these characters. They come to life before my eyes and they splash of the screen. NICE.More good: this movie has got an EDGE. It's dark, it's violent. Like it suppose to be. Direction, soundtrack, photography, editing. Every technical detail is TOP NOTCH. What a joy for my eyes.Not any good? Lasting a whopping 2 hours and 45 minutes is stretching it, but this is one of those FEW action movies in which it could have lasted another hour and I still would have been GLUED to the screen.Bravo! They nailed it with this version. Recommended? YES. Spread the word....

Review: 5 out of 5 stars.The Batman is an electrifying dark superhero film and dives into an psychological crime story. Director Matt Reeves takes this film into a whole new dark direction. So dark that every scene seems faded or taking place in a night raining setting. The script and narration in the beginning sets the tone of the film. With Bruce Wayne giving a narrative about how he brings fear that every criminal stays away from the shadows. The film is one awesome superhero film. Watching it the first time may not be enough with so much to digest on what is going on with the depth layer of the story. For a 3 hour run time, the film packs so much that it never once felt long.The script and direction is great. Dark atmospheric setting. Showing Gotham a city that is on a ticking time bomb with crime happening. Nirvana's song playing a couple of times setting that mood of the film. Which is dark and setting that depressing mood. But it works great. The action sequences are great. The fight scenes are well choregraphed. The villains Riddler played by Paul Dano is great. Riddler played more like a zodiac killer. The direction plays like a crime solving film with Batman being detective and on the trail of the riddler. Leading Batman investigating criminal syndicates like Falcone (John Turturro) and Penguin (Colin Farrell). And catwoman (Zoe Kravitz) assisting him with the investigation. The film gritty and grounded with its action sequences. The car chase was awesome with the cinematography being close to the action as possible.Robert Pattinson is great as a dark version of Bruce Wayne. And great as Batman. Paul Dano is good. John Turturro, Colin Farrell, Zoe Kravitz, Andy Serkis, and Jeffrey Wright were all great with there roles.The cinematography and music score were great. The film does have one brief scene that hints towards another film. The film has a deep depth story that packs a lot and ties a lot together. It is one awesome film that will leave a lot talking about.

Review: RRR (2022) : Movie Review -High and Low. No, I'm not talking about Akira Kurosawa's Japanese flick from 1963, but I'm talking about SS Rajamouli's RRR. Actually, that's the best brief for the film I can think of. SS Rajamouli has been making mass-friendly commercial films for a long time, but Bahubali brought him pan-India popularity. He became a household name and a BRAND! So naturally, anything he would do after Bahubali was meant to look smaller or look comparatively less because the bar was set too high for any filmmaker and for himself too. The same happened with Prabhas when he came after Bahubali with "Saaho" and "Radhe Shyam". Let's just accept the fact that a film like "Bahubali : The Conclusion" (2017) can't be made again and again. Not just because it was a Massive Blockbuster, but also because the kind of extraordinary commercial cinema it presents is almost impossible nowadays. When I saw Bahubali 2, I called it the Greatest Commercial Entertainer of this millennium after Gadar (2001). Surprisingly, these two films are the only ones in this century to sell 5 crore+ tickets in the Hindi belt. It was acceptable to see such heroic characters in Bahubali because the film is set in an ancient period, which makes it reasonable. But with RRR, it can't be held reasonable enough because the film is set in the 20th century, where you expect some humanly possible stuff. It doesn't matter how big (fictionally) your character is, it has to make some sense when it comes to on-screen persona, as we have had so many legendary personalities during this period, who have served the nation till the last drop of their blood, and it all came with human restrictions. RRR looks problematic in that sense, but if you talk about mass cinema, then RRR is simply phenomenal.RRR is a fictional tale set in the 1920s. Two Indian revolutionaries, Rama Raju (Ram Charan) and Komaram Bheem (Jr. NTR), try to fight the mighty British Empire and Nizam of Hyderabad in their own ways, which are interestingly opposite and unknown to each other. Bheem is after a little girl who has been abducted by British officer Steve (Ray Stevenson) and his wife, Lady Scott (Alison Doody), while Rama is a British cop who tries to stop him. Two powerful heroes, one fiRe and one wateR, are pitted against each other, and then you get to know about their agendas in the second half when the story unfolds the past events.RRR presents Ram Charan and Jr. NTR in never-seen-before avatars. Rajamouli makes sure that their crazy mass fan following gets enough content to have a big mass party in the cinema halls. Ram Charan enters with a 5-minute long action scene, which does look a little too extraordinary for an ordinary mind, but that's what "mass cinema" means, right? On the other hand, Jr. NTR has got a crazy mass entry that has a class too. That entire forest sequence will blow your mind. A good happy warning to all Tarak fans: please keep your expectations high because Bheem is going to exceed all of them. The pair of Rama and Bheem work like a fireworks display during all those large-scale action sequences. Talking about the supporting cast, especially two Hindi actors, Ajay Devgn and Alia Bhatt, both have small but important cameos. Ajay Devgn does the speaking with his intense eyes again, and in other news, the sky is blue. This man has some charisma of his own. It's only a matter of a genius filmmaker who can use it correctly. Alia Bhatt as Sita looks gorgeous in every single scene, and her character plays a vital part in the narrative. Olivia Morris sparkles the screen with her beauty, and her accent is too cute. Alison Doody is the exact opposite of that, but that's what the villainous characters do. Both Samuthirakani and Shriya Saran appear in small roles, and both pass with good grades.RRR's basic script is as good as any Telugu action drama (mind you, some call it mindless), but the screenplay doesn't match that certain level you are expecting. The second half may bore you with outdated melodrama and may cause a little irritation too. All those flaws will be forgiven when you witness the Big-screen extravaganza in 3D. The action sequences of RRR have set the benchmark for all the filmmakers in India. Rajamouli outperforms himself from wherever he has done Bahubali. That film still had battlefield references to help a bit, but RRR, despite being driven by two characters, provides a better visual spectacle than Bahubali. That's not a small thing, mind you. The music of RRR is going to create some hysteria in theatres. If you don't feel like dancing while "Naacho Naacho," I'd say please consult a doctor. You are not normal. "Dosti" has got nice tunes for a situational song, and "Komuram Bheemudo" will take you all by surprise. I'm not sure if you can hear "Raamam Raaghavam" clearly because there will be a lot of noise, including big screams and whistles, going around at the time. But you'll ask for a repeat viewing after reaching home.It's been more than two years since we haven't had a big pan-India event film and SS Rajamouli brings back that much needed "Big-Screen Experience" for us. Undoubtedly, the best director in India when it comes to commercial cinema. The name is SS Rajamouli! His extraordinary vision of looking at ordinary things is what makes him better than other filmmakers in India. Bahubali was an ordinary script, but it's Rajamouli who made it an extraordinary film. No matter how many resemblances you find between it and "The Lion King" or its original source material, Shakespeare's Hamlet, it's a story every Indian can relate to. That's the same case with RRR, despite some flaws in the writing. But that's where Rajamouli's genius mind works overtime. He presents the high-octane mass hysteria that is sure to make the masses go crazy. The hardcore patriotism will please a certain section too. Whether it be the introduction scenes of the two lead actors or that train bridge action scene or that pre-interval rampage or even that mind-boggling climax in the forest, SS Rajamouli has outdone himself. He has reached a level that other commercial directors in Indian cinema can never reach or even dream about. Give this man a weak script and he will still make a strong mass entertainer out of it. That's what he has done with RRR. Every single viewer is going to hail him for his superlative vision of how to look at period action dramas. Every filmmaker who wants to make a great mass film should learn from him. As a whole, RRR packs a solid punch of out-and-out commercial entertainer that we have been missing since the Bahubali juggernaut. Just don't mind the below average writing, and you are going to LOVE IT!RATING - 6/10*

Naattu song is the cherry on top, whole theatre goes mad on this one... the interval block action sequence is real jaw dropping one, even though we can guess this one, but cant guess the scale...Second half starts with bit slow flashback, but it picks up to the paek immediately. Second half has more sentiments and more screen space for RC. RC outshines NTR in lot of places... All the action blocks are gravity defying but enjoyable.... After credit Janta song has cameo from Rajamouli. When the movie ends it was like completing the festival celebration....Exceeding expectations in all aspects....

Review: The last time director SS Rajamouli managed to wow the audience was in 2017 with the film Baahubali: The Conclusion. It took him five long years for him to conceptualise his next film RRR, shoot and bring it to the silver screen. Pulling off a multi-starrer with Jr NTR and Ram Charan in the lead roles might seem an accomplishment in itself. But Rajamouli manages to deliver even when it comes to the story.RRR runs on a relatively simple premise. There's 'fire' - an angry, young police officer Ramaraju (Ram Charan) who is both revered and feared by the British. He has done their every bidding for years, he is the one they sic on anyone they want to capture and yet, he is the one who's never given enough respect due to the colour of his skin. Then there's 'water' - sweet, simple, innocent Bheem (Jr NTR) who has brute strength but uses it only when it serves his purpose. He's a Gond tribal who has come to the city to rescue a young girl called Malli, who was taken away by Lady Scott (Alison Doody), to be the singing doll 'on (her) mantelpiece'. But that is just the beginning of the tale.Rajamouli's new calling cards seem to be building new world. Because, despite being based on two revolutionaries from history, RRR has a story that's completely fictional. Delhi of the 1920s becomes his new canvas. Bheem might have fought against the Nizams, so much so that one of them finds it imperative to warn the British that he's not to be taken lightly. But he also finds shelter with Muslims in Delhi. Ramaraju might seem like a well-trained soldier who will follow instructions blindly but he also seems to have a past no one but his uncle (Samuthirakani) knows about. Scott (Ray Stevenson) might believe 'brown rubbish' deserve even a bullet to be wasted on them but Jennifer (Olivia Morris) seems more empathetic. This is not the freedom movement where you turn the other cheek, this is the one where you use your hands as weapons.The first half of RRR runs like clockwork. There's the emotional core in Malli, there's the song and dance with Naatu Naatu (it'll make you smile) and a friendship explored through Dosti, there's even a few laughs whenever Bheem tries to befriend Jennifer. Cinematic liberties are taken but they don't seem as noticable as in the later portions, half where the film falters a bit. Some scenes seem to drag frustratingly because we already know something a core character doesn't. The way Ramaraju's fiancÃ© Sita (Alia Bhatt) is woven into the narrative, apart from Ram Charan's transformation to another look also seem forced in a tale that was smooth sailing. After the way Bheem is set up effortlessly despite nothing much being told, the way Ramaraju's story unfolds seems strained. The climax leaves more to be desired. The good thing however is that the film manages to surprise you. Rajamouli also manages to use certain tropes set up in the initial portions of the film in the latter portions cleverly.None-the-less Rajamouli manages to pull off something people have been pining for - a commercial, action drama that will keep you thoroughly entertained - which it does. The length also doesn't prove to be a hindrance, thanks to a tight screenplay. The VFX in certain portions could've been better. Jr NTR pulls off his career's best performance. He's charming as Bheem, especially in the emotional bits and his desperation to find Malli comes through well, so does his love for Ramaraju. Ram Charan also does well, pouring soul into the transformations his character goes through. Tarak and Charan's roles require them to have chemistry, which they do. Alia Bhatt, Olivia Morris, Samuthirakani, Ajay Devgn, Shriya Saran and others play their parts well. Olivia in particular manages to win your heart. Alison and Ray breeze through their roles. Keeravani's OST for the film might not be for everyone but he does well with the BGM. Senthil's camerawork is a delight too.RRR is not perfection by any means because after the way Rajamouli pulls off certain scenes, you wonder if he could've done a better job in others. But watch this one this weekend if you've been longing for a good action packed drama. Especially so if you're a fan of the lead duo.

Review: I'm not a native Telugu speaking audience so the first time i was exposed to ss rajamouli was when i saw eega that movie also i watched because i heard that ajay devgan was dubbing for the film from that day to this day you can say I'm a fanboy.RRR bleeds ss rajamouli in every frame from the action to dance to the most mundain dilogue it has what i call rajamouli pitch to the film. The filmis three hours long but it never feel like it,the editing and cinematography is awesome the only bad thing about the film is the songs are not as good as his favourite filmsThe film is casted perfectly Ram Charan has played his most wonderful character, NTR has restraint yet powerful presence to the film Alia Bhatt is graceful. All the foreign actors are well casted special mention to the Olivia moris. Ajay Devgan is awesome even in a limited screen presence i would be tempted to say he outperormed both the heros of the Film.The best thing about the film though is the action choreography and it was expected to be good but that have surpassed my expectations same goes with visual effects.The action set peieces were meticulously planned and perfectly excuted.The film will leave you with a wow and it will touch your heart one way or another.one of the most wonderful films i have seen in past few years.

Review: The greatest achievement is not making an industry defining franchise but to give the right follow up to it. Expectations are higher, challenges are higher and the chances of a misfire is at its highest. Visionary directors like Spielberg and James Cameron have proven it on the biggest stage but in Asian cinema, Rajamouli has established himself as the master of making magnum opus movies.The Bahubaali films aside from being box office behemoths, helped Telugu film industry to be popular across the country. Naturally, RRR is expected to reach that benchmark and it does largely to the fantastic lead performances from Ram Charan and Junior NTR. After multiple delays due to the pandemic, RRR hit screens at the right moment without compromising the post production work to hit the screens quickly.On a technical scale, it outdoes Bahubaali considerably. Even the unrealistic action sequences exhilirate you so well that you forget about the logic going out of the window. The criticisms of RRR is it's lack of screentime and proper writing for it's female characters. Like all Indian films it has the troupe of a damsel waiting to be rescued by our macho hero. While Junior NTR and Ram Charan play compelling leads it's tough not to wonder if they were playing The Hulk and Thor, considering they are unfazed by wild animals and bullet injuries.Ultimately RRR is a well made semi-fictional historical drama with the right amount "mass" movements to satisfy the audience. Rajamouli has clearly done his homework and has shown us again why he is the most consistent director in Telugu cinema.

Review: A story about 2 individuals and their respective missions. Its has nothing to do with the India's independence and all....Alluri Sitarama Raju and Komaram Bheema played by Ram Charan and Junior NTR had done an amazing performance. They just toiled for this movie...Visual Effects, Action Stunts, BGM was the highlighting factor as we focus only on story line it will be a disaster as these commercial elements is required to make the audience watch for 3hrs...Breath taking action sequences during the Hero's introduction, interval and at climax which we should definitely expect from a Rajamouli Film...Sabu Cyril production design was fantastic as he able to met the expectations of the director.Alia Bhat failed to impress whereas Ajay Devgn done his cameo performance very well...RRR is all of mass movie with high octane action sequences...The cinematography especially was fabulous as an it just able to say us "Whoaaa"Nattu Nattu song was just awesome as we could see the fast pace Junior NTR and Ram Charan doing their steps and that too with a proper coordination which just have to be experienced over a big screen..Overall its a visual impact treat which at PVR big screen or at Dolby Atmos can be watched.. That kind of efforts the team had put...So RRR a mass entertainer visual impact movie.

Review: Both the main leads are super heros who can do anything with their super powers. It gets repeating, repeating throughout the movie. From the beginning the movie is just about the super heros. Ajay and alia are just cameo roles for hindi audience.

Review: Overall, RRR is probably Rajamouli career best since Bahubali frainchase. While it also became NTR and Ram Charan best film since Magadheera, Rangasthalam and Aravinda Sametha Veera Raghava.Music is excellent and direction is great. Sure I think RRR going to set opening record.Definitely a must watch.

Review: This time Rajamouli missed to make an ordinary story into an extraordinary one . Story was good for a commercial movie . First movie started with terrific intro of Ram and Bheem , each of them intro was very well elevated . First half was really good and interesting , all the commercial elements were very well balanced . Second half was quite boring , and some of the over the top scenes really made it an average one . Both Ram Charan and Jr. NTR gave excellent performance . Ajay Devgn had less screentime , but done his part well. Execepted more screentime for Alia . Technically strong movie . Comparing to our Indian standard , VFX were really topnotch . Action sequence were well choreographed . Mind blowing music and songs . Cinematography was good . Kindly avoid 3D Version , it was really pathetic . Overall worth for money and time , it could've been excellent commercial movie if Second half was well concentrated . A good weekend watch with your family .WARNING : AVOID 3D VERSION.

Review: The Lost City has pieces that work and pieces that don't. Placing pretenders into an actual adventure is good for laughs and heart, yet much of this script is generic. Unimaginative MacGuffins, flat villains, and predictable romances are individually forgivable, but together, they override the premise's charm. Furthermore, the dialogue, humor, and plot devices are subpar. The cast enhances the material (especially Pitt and Radcliffe), but some scenes are groaners. Tatum's charisma shines through and Pitt's cameo provides flavor, but that isn't enough to pull The Lost City out of mediocrity. It isn't painful, but The Lost City misses more than it hits.Meanwhile, The Lost City's filmmaking is average. Its minor positives are the cinematography (intermittently dramatizing comedy and action), the sound (selling the combat and jungle setting), the production design (primarily real but often computerized), and the effects (employing real explosions amongst the CGI). Conversely, the editing occasionally sags (lingering on unessential jokes) and the music is distractingly trendy (forcing fun, rather than serving the narrative). Lastly, The Lost City lacks cohesion. Its humor and emotions never tonally blend, and instead take turns (which disconnects viewers). Ultimately, The Lost City has mild appeal, but functions inconsistently.Writing: 3/10 Direction: 3/10 Cinematography: 6/10 Acting: 5/10 Editing: 4/10 Sound: 6/10 Score/Soundtrack: 4/10 Production Design: 6/10 Casting: 8/10 Effects: 6/10Overall Score: 5.1/10.

Review: Greetings again from the darkness. It's not billed as a remake of ROMANCING THE STONE (1984), and perhaps that's because it borrows from many adventure romantic-comedies over the years. Brothers and co-directors Aaron Nee and Adam Nee (BAND OF ROBBERS, 2015) have proven they can deliver exactly what is promised from a script by co-writers Oren Uziel (MORTAL COMBAT, 2021) and Dana Fox (CRUELLA, 2021). Seth Gordon receives a story credit, which is a bit ironic considering he has been quoted with, "The best stories are rooted in reality."Oscar winner Sandra Bullock stars as grieving, reclusive and highly successful romance novelist Loretta Sage, and Channing Tatum co-stars as her long-time and extremely popular cover model, Adam (in what is obviously a 'wink and a nod' to Fabio). Loretta's love of history, and the passing of her husband, have combined to make her despise the books she writes and the publicity tours she's required to attend ... especially when being forced to wear a skintight purple/fuchsia sequined onesie. On the other hand, vapid model Adam relishes giving the audience what they want - strutting, hair waving, and bare chest.After their most recent event goes sideways, Loretta is kidnapped by the villainous rich guy with a so-called gender-neutral name of Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe). He's read her latest book and needs her help in locating the 'Crown of Fire' hidden somewhere on a remote island he purchased for this reason. Things have to move quickly before the volcano erupts and buries the treasure. At this point, Adam is committed to rescuing Loretta and proving that he's more than a pretty face. Loretta's stressed out literary agent Beth (Da'Vine Joy Randolph, DOLEMITE IS MY NAME, 2019) is determined to save her writer-asset, while the newly hired social media director (Patti Harrison) acts goofy (and deserved better lines).It's regrettable, yet a sign of the times, that (2-time Oscar winner) Brad Pitt's cameo is included in the trailer. This should have been a pleasant surprise for viewers, and instead is spoiled by the clip. He has fun with his role as former Navy Seal and meditation partner with Adam, as the two work towards Loretta's rescue. The time on the island combines the adventure sequences with the slow-build of the romantic bond between Loretta and Adam, and both actors do their thing. It's mostly Mr. Radcliffe who seems a bit out of place as he goes big in his role as villain, when some subtlety might have played better. Then again, there is nothing subtle about this production, including the scenes with Beth and an oddball pilot with a goat-fetish played by Oscar Nunez ("The Office").Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum can play these characters in their sleep, and to their credit, they both seem engaged and willing to put forth the necessary effort. Tatum especially embraces the duality of a preening cover boy and the sensitive type out to prove he has substance. It's an easy film to criticize, but why would you? It's meant to be harmless fun and bring joy to movie lovers. It's totally fine to make a silly formulaic movie when your objective is to make a silly formulaic movie.Opening in theaters on March 25, 2022.

Review: 7.0/10I actually enjoyed this film way more than I expected. It perfectly fits into its categories of action, adventure, comedy, and romance.The story was very enjoyable. It started off kind of wonky and felt like I was in for a bad time, but once the "prologue" passed and the main portion of the movie started it got much better.The chemistry between Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum worked surprisingly well, and only got better as the film progressed. I did enjoy Daniel Radcliffe as the antagonist. More of a bratty rich boy than an evil "I want to murder everyone" kind of bad guy.By the end I felt that the big part of the film was that the romance was definitely geared towards the women while the action parts were geared towards the men. The comedy could've gone either way, and some may find certain parts funnier than others, both scenes and what's actually funny.I also enjoyed the score. The way certain soundtracks were worked into the scenes noticeably helped enhance them (as soundtracks should).Overall, I think this film is perfect for a movie date night. It's funny, it's romantic, it has a pretty good action/adventure story and it's not as cheesy as most romcoms tend to be.I hope my review helps you make a choice on this film. Until next time.... Enjoy the show!

Review: The chemistry between Bullock and Pitt is beyond words even though for only a minute or two. It's so powerful that it dulls the chemistry between Channing and Bullock. It's too bad that Brad wasn't given a much larger role as he has a real knack for comedy. It was likely to keep costs down or maybe he couldn't commit to more shooting days. If budget wasn't an issue I would have written a few more Pitt scenes in and maybe less goat. They tried to milk the goat bit (sorry) and it just wasn't funny. Radcliffe was good too and again he could have used a few more scenes. Still, money well spent just to watch Brad for a few minutes as he stole the entire movie.

Review: Liked: This wasn't the typical romcom that is sappy and silly. Performances by everyone that had screen time. Pacing was great too.Not so much: Editing. There seems like a small chunk of the movie was missing and they tried to cover it with a quick transition.Loved: Brad's Pitt and Daniel Radcliffe. Both stole the show in each scene they were in.I really enjoyed this flick. Way more than I thought I was going to. I'm glad I saw this because this flick wasn't the typical sappy and silly romcoms tend to be associated with. It was action packed, had a lot of humor in it with some solid performances. Brad's Pitt and Daniel Radcliffe were awesome in this. Pitt nailed all his comedic timing and Radcliffe has great range and played the villain role really well. So much that one day he should play a Bond villain. Looked like he was having a lot of fun with this. No post credit but there is a great mid credit scene that adds to the story. Solid movie!

Review: Mainstream comedies that actually make it to theatres are slim to none these days. I remember a time when there was possibly a big comedy coming out every one or two months, with at least half of them being good, but in today's climate, humour is just tough to get right. I was very happy to see that Paramount would be taking a chance and releasing a big comedy in The Lost City this year, but I truly didn't know to what to expect from it. After seeing it in theatres, I'm happy to say that I had a good time with it. It's not great, but it felt like a throwback comedy, just with a modern twist.To put it simply, The Lost City follows Loretta (Sandra Bullock) as she's on a book tour with her cover model Alan (Channing Tatum) to promote the release of "The Lost City of D," but they are swept up in a kidnapping and find themselves on a real adventure in the jungle. Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe) is the reason Loretta was kidnapped in the first place, as he sees many similarities in her book to that of a real lost city. Being the privileged twerp that he is makes for a fun villainous storyline, even if it's pretty lame at times. Radcliffe aside (whom I still enjoyed), this film puts all of its weight on Tatum and Bullock to deliver the goods.This premise is clever enough to work as a film, but it all comes down to who you cast and if they can make the material work. I never thought I needed to see this duo together, but I'm very happy they worked so well. On top of that, I have to admit that the best moments in the film feature Brad Pitt's character Jack Trainer. He isn't in the film much, but every second he was on screen had me laughing. Where I found the film to be slightly uneven though, was in the fact that I wasn't sure if it wanted to be funny or dramatic at times.I'm all for heartfelt storylines as well as comedy, but I would argue that the majority of the humour is in the first half, while the second half gets a little more sentimental. These both worked in the movie, but the way the film begins gives absolutely no foreshadowing as to what the film will become by the end. I found that odd, but again, the cast sold all of the dialogue for me. From a few hilarious moments to some fun adventure/action throughout, as I said, I had a good time with this one.In the end, The Lost City is exactly what I think moviegoers need right now. Nothing too serious or weighed down by heavy drama. This is a good old-fashioned, silly comedy/romance that I feel works for what it is. It's not going to be the type of comedy that a lot of people are going to watch over and over again, at least I don't think, but the heart of the film is in the right place and it never takes anything too seriously. Now playing in theatres, I'd give a recommendation to The Lost City.

On top of that, I have to admit that the best moments in the film feature Brad Pitt's character Jack Trainer. He isn't in the film much, but every second he was on screen had me laughing. Where I found the film to be slightly uneven though, was in the fact that I wasn't sure if it wanted to be funny or dramatic at times.I'm all for heartfelt storylines as well as comedy, but I would argue that the majority of the humour is in the first half, while the second half gets a little more sentimental. These both worked in the movie, but the way the film begins gives absolutely no foreshadowing as to what the film will become by the end. I found that odd, but again, the cast sold all of the dialogue for me. From a few hilarious moments to some fun adventure/action throughout, as I said, I had a good time with this one.In the end, The Lost City is exactly what I think moviegoers need right now. Nothing too serious or weighed down by heavy drama. This is a good old-fashioned, silly comedy/romance that I feel works for what it is. It's not going to be the type of comedy that a lot of people are going to watch over and over again, at least I don't think, but the heart of the film is in the right place and it never takes anything too seriously. Now playing in theatres, I'd give a recommendation to The Lost City.

Review: In the adventure/romance genre, this film is hugely disappointing. It adds nothing new, and lacks basic elements that are necessary to make such films 'work.' Bullock. Appealing as usual, and an extended cameo by Brad Pitt are the two saving graces, for their fans, though both are failed by a muddled, simplistic storyline and generally unfunny dialogue.Tatum's man-child demeanor as the protagonist romance novelist (Bullock)'s fellow adventurist-and potential romantic interest, is miscast. Bullock's mega-star presence eclipses his. His super-nice hunky- guy character moons over her, seeming at times as if he's medicated with something that keeps him from displaying emotion. It isn't bad acting- it's emotion-free acting. Bottom-line: the Bullock/Tatum 'chemistry' does not work here. See 'Romancing The Stone' for an example of how this should* have worked. Fan favorite Daniel Radcliffe plays the (far too-mildly) eccentric heavy, pursuing Bullock/Tatum. He seems to try to make the best of the character, but- again- screenplay and direction disappoint.It's 'just' watchable for fans of the cast.. I suppose.

Review: It is a ridiculous, upbeat, laugh out loud romantic comedy. If you go in wanting to have a good time, you will. If you are expecting something believable at all, you will be sorely disappointed but if you have seen a single trailer or even a movie poster, you shouldnt have those expectations. I love the way Sandra Bullock makes ordinary situations relatably funny, like high stools. They are impossible to get on without looking stupid. Channing Tattum does a great job at trying to be the charming hero. Some of his lines are hiliarious and if you arent paying attention you will miss them entirely. So sit back and just enjoy the comedy for what it is meant to be.

Review: Maybe its me, but my idea of a rom-com is not to have the heroine kidnapped and threatened for two hours. Its not funny. Yes, i know its a movie. Daniel radcliffe is quite nasty here as the bad guy. Anyway sandy gets kidnapped and channing sets out to rescue her. Stuff happens. Non of it the least bit funny. Certainly my audience didn't laugh.

Review: The first half of this movie is really funny. I was laughing more than most in the theater. There are so many well-written jokes and situational humor with about an 80% hit rate, including a few hilarious moments. The characters are fleshed out enough for me to care. The story is formulaic and relatively weak compared to the other aspects, but that's easily forgiven when it's making me laugh.In the second half, the laughs slow down drastically. It gets a lot more serious with attempts at character arcs and story moments that aren't bad but are things we've seen a thousand times. I didn't hate watching it, but without as much comedy it's a much weaker movie.The first half is easily seven stars. The second half is a weak six. I wouldn't mind watching this again but I wouldn't go out of my way to do so. (1 viewing, opening Thursday night 3/24/2022)

I still rewatch many of them today. Movies have become overly serious. I miss Movies that provide entertainment but with a sense of humor. Channing Tatum and Sandra bullock make a great duo. The cameo is also fantastic. I highly recommend this movie and I suggest everyone enjoy it in the theaters.

Review: There are many moments in this flick, where they go to a wider shot and you hear a piece of dialogue used to add chuckles into the flick. A nice little trick to infuse these things into the flick. But they did it so many times, it started to stand out that they went in with a very lackluster project...However... ...there's is absolutely nothing wrong with this movie. And everyone involved knows it. As well as the people watching it. It is a very nice diversion from some of the darkness of the world. And yes, it is derivative of "Romancing The Stone" The trailer had me screaming this out loud. But I suppose its time for another jungle adventure with a mismatched couple.The story is of, Loretta Sage, a widower somewhat-world famous romantic novelist who's lost spark in her work, as well as her life after the death of an archaeologist husband. On a fateful book signing tour of her derivative trash novel, she is saddled with the coverboy model of her books, Dash, who is actually named Alan, here played by Channing Tatum. When she is kidnapped by Abigail (Daniel Radcliffe) in order to decipher a cryptic message from a treasure myth. Dash/Alan sets out to prove himself to Loretta that he is more than a pretty face.A few problems here though... 1) Why not help with the finding of a treasure? What is the reason why she is so against helping Abigail? Regardless of whether or not they find it, it's not like he's using The Crown Of Fire to rule the universe. There is no given reason, other than she is dead inside and it's a waste of time. But, we've established time is all she had. Which is frustrating to watch.2) Why does Dash even like her? Presumably, they've done a few of these junkets together and I'm sure she wasn't pleasant to him then. A lot could have been mined in his puppy dog crush on her. But, the story paints her out to be a very cynical bitter person who is better off without joy in her life. A simple fix would be when Alan tells her the story of his background, he simply needs to say "All those conventions we did together, you never once gave me a chance to make Dash real for you. To you he may be a figment of your imagination, but I love that person. It brought so much joy to people who don't have the hope you have. At least that's what it seemed like" Then he could follow up with "I guess they shouldn't judge a book by its cover" (instead of what was in the movie "you of all people should know not to judge a book by its cover) This solves a few problems. One, her fans REALLY love her stories. Two, it bridges the gap with his affection for her. As it is, she makes a fool of him at the book release and he still fawns over her. That's bad.But look, again, there is nothing wrong with the movie. It's a sweet innocent flick that doesn't pretend it's not something else.The ending may leave a few people feeling flat, as it wraps up so cleanly it feels shoehorned. Ideally, the ending could have been we are back at another book release and she looks and acts differently to her fans. Ala "Galaxy Quest" And Alan comes out looking as he is, and they both pose happily with the fans. We sense that she has gotten her groove back. And has moved on with her life.

Review: I wouldn't pay a premium price to see this, but it's funny and fun. Some great laughs, Gotta say, Sandra Bulloch's behind looks pretty fine for a woman in her fifties. Channing Tatum is a good foil for Bulloch's brainy character, although his character's evolution doesn't seem very consistent throughout the movie. Dan Radcliffe makes a convincing villain and Brad Pitt is a very amusing supporting character without stealing the movie. It just goes to show that good actors and a decent plot and writing can make even lightweight fare quite satisfying, for an afternoon matinee, at least. There's a sequel suggested...I'd definitely consider seeing that one.

Review: Robert Pattinson transitions from a vampire to a batman, proving anyone that can imitate a low raspy voice can be Batman in a costume. As Bruce Wayne, Pattinson was a joke as a brooding goth billionaire who can't afford a good haircut or a comb. He combats the Riddler (Paul Dano) who like Batman is a vigilante wanting to clean up the city, corruption that leads back to Wayne's parents. BTW What was his mother's secret that caused everything? Zoë Kravitz did an excellent Catwoman and was every bit as good as Halle Berry's Razzy performance. Colin Farrell was not recognizable as the Penguin, who was on the good-bad line. Gollum (Andy Serkis) as Alfred was simply bad casting. I kept waiting for him to say his master was a trickster.In spite of the downfalls, the script, action, and mystery held my interest. Riddler reminded me of Anonymous and would have been better in a Guy Fawkes mask. The climax was not overly exciting and I am not sure why everyone in the city had to be punished.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.

Review: I assume there are still people out there that cannot stand Robert Pattinson. This dislike was born when he accepted one of the main roles in the Twilight universe. If you are one of those, I do not think I will be able to sway you - to convince you otherwise. I could tell you, that he has proven himself as an actor in many films since then. And when I say that I am not trying to put the Twilight Saga down. I was not the target audience of that - still I saw some interesting things in there, but also things that I did not like at all.But this is about ... The Batman! A distinction in the title - maybe to be able to find it better when browsing or looking for it. Because and I'm sure you are aware of that: there are many other movies called Batman. Actually before Marvel took over the reigns, DC was the one producing good comic book movies. Superman and Batman being the most noteable ones. No one back then thought of combining the heroes though. Everyone stayed in their lane. Something this movie does too. And maybe it is better if DC does not emulate or copy the MCU formula ... I understand that it is more than tempting considering all the money that is involved of course.All that history aside, this as I already said, is a standalone movie. This is about The Batman! And while you may have your favorite (Keaton, West or Bale - though maybe even Affleck or the unlikely choice of Kilmer or Clooney), do not condemn the Patts just yet. He really transforms and gets into the role ... a role that anyone should consider an honor to play.I am overall a MCU fan boy as some may call me. But I have a deep love for the Bats. And while that makes me at least somewhat biased, this is not the reason I am surprised the movie has such a high rating. I am surprised because the movie is long (even if you don't really feel it - even when you may think at times "alright we have spent quite a lot of time lingering haven't we?") and because it is quite dark ... pun intended. The tone and the overall lighting of the movie.There is violence here - things that a decade or so ago, you may not have been able to get away with and still get a PG13 rating. Bashing of the head with a blunt object? Yes you don't get close ups and there is not as much blood to be seen as with other movies that also have head bashings - but just the thought and certain glimpses we get to see ... is more than enough.But all that and the fact this is a detective story ... really help elevate the movie. That and a strong cast of people. I thought Jared Leto had one of the greatest transformations for House of Gucci ... but Colin Farrell actually isn't recognizable in this. And would also fit in the House of Gucci, considering the italian accent/New York slang he uses.The darkness and the shadows play a big role. And you may find yourself looking to find something in them ... even something (or someone?) that doesn't exist/is there. The action scenes are really well played out - there is even one that reminisces that feeling you may have had playing a game or two with the Batman. Arkham City may arguably be the best game of the series - with a fighting system that really is extraordinary. Many have tried to copy it - but I never felt that seemless flow in anything else I've played since then.And then there is the sound system ... I watched it in Imax too, though it doesn't seem to have been filmed with an Imax camera. Still bigger screen so all good. But the sound ... wow! Just wow - incredible.So while I still feel that The Dark Knight is a bit better - this comes as close as they get. Coincidences and convenient timing aside. Because a lot of things have to go right (or wrong depending on your perspective) for the movie and the story to work ... still small and minor "flaws" like that aside - because that should not stop you from enjoying this very well made movie.Edit: Since this is not an origin story, but still the beginnings of Batman, he is not invincible and he may not have every gimmick/toy/car/vehicle you may expect him to have. There is one truly great car chase though ... I personally would not compare it to the real great ones you may have seen (Bullit, French Connection and so forth) and just see it as a thing that works on its own. Also the added bonus - after credits "scene" - is really not something that many will think worthwhile ... as in worth staying and watching the credits through to get this ... well let's call it easter egg, that is not really a scene, but a callback to a scene from earlier ... with a promise for the future one may say. Still you can google it and it probably will have the same effect as if you watched it "unfold".

Review: I assume there are still people out there that cannot stand Robert Pattinson. This dislike was born when he accepted one of the main roles in the Twilight universe. If you are one of those, I do not think I will be able to sway you - to convince you otherwise. I could tell you, that he has proven himself as an actor in many films since then. And when I say that I am not trying to put the Twilight Saga down. I was not the target audience of that - still I saw some interesting things in there, but also things that I did not like at all.But this is about ... The Batman! A distinction in the title - maybe to be able to find it better when browsing or looking for it. Because and I'm sure you are aware of that: there are many other movies called Batman. Actually before Marvel took over the reigns, DC was the one producing good comic book movies. Superman and Batman being the most noteable ones. No one back then thought of combining the heroes though. Everyone stayed in their lane. Something this movie does too. And maybe it is better if DC does not emulate or copy the MCU formula ... I understand that it is more than tempting considering all the money that is involved of course.All that history aside, this as I already said, is a standalone movie. This is about The Batman! And while you may have your favorite (Keaton, West or Bale - though maybe even Affleck or the unlikely choice of Kilmer or Clooney), do not condemn the Patts just yet. He really transforms and gets into the role ... a role that anyone should consider an honor to play.I am overall a MCU fan boy as some may call me. But I have a deep love for the Bats. And while that makes me at least somewhat biased, this is not the reason I am surprised the movie has such a high rating. I am surprised because the movie is long (even if you don't really feel it - even when you may think at times "alright we have spent quite a lot of time lingering haven't we?") and because it is quite dark ... pun intended. The tone and the overall lighting of the movie.There is violence here - things that a decade or so ago, you may not have been able to get away with and still get a PG13 rating. Bashing of the head with a blunt object? Yes you don't get close ups and there is not as much blood to be seen as with other movies that also have head bashings - but just the thought and certain glimpses we get to see ... is more than enough.But all that and the fact this is a detective story ... really help elevate the movie. That and a strong cast of people. I thought Jared Leto had one of the greatest transformations for House of Gucci ... but Colin Farrell actually isn't recognizable in this. And would also fit in the House of Gucci, considering the italian accent/New York slang he uses.The darkness and the shadows play a big role. And you may find yourself looking to find something in them ... even something (or someone?) that doesn't exist/is there. The action scenes are really well played out - there is even one that reminisces that feeling you may have had playing a game or two with the Batman. Arkham City may arguably be the best game of the series - with a fighting system that really is extraordinary. Many have tried to copy it - but I never felt that seemless flow in anything else I've played since then.And then there is the sound system ...

Review: This film delivers a much darker and more sinister Batman, quite unlike the many versions that have gone before. The representation of Gotham as well, is steeped in corruption and decay. The story opens with the death of the city's mayor, and from there introduces the principal characters that are part of the Batman legacy that are known all too well by fans. In tone, I think this film was more like the "Gotham" cable series than any of the prior movies, even if that show had more to do with the young Bruce Wayne growing into the masked crime fighter. The villains both in "Gotham" and in this story personified the evil and malice that gripped Batman's hometown, with an added element of corruption in the background of Bruce Wayne's father that put him under the thumb of crime boss Carmine Falcone (John Turturro).All of the performances here were exceptional. Robert Pattinson's take on Batman was more effective than his portrayal of Bruce Wayne, who looked like he was part of the grunge scene. I didn't much care for the Batman outfit, it looked unusually heavy and clunky; one's first inkling that Batman was arriving was heralded by the thumping footsteps one might associate with "Jurassic Park". Pattinson's voice as Batman, as well as those of Lieutenant Gordon (Jeffrey Wright) and The Riddler (Paul Dano) sounded like they were coming through a synthesizer. It made for dramatic effect, although not quite realistic.This film version of The Riddler is not like anything you've seen before or would have expected. His off-screen portrayals hinted at a demented masked vigilante, which made the actual appearance of the character that much more compelling when it revealed an almost baby faced Dano in the role of a psychotic madman. Quite honestly, it wasn't until the credits rolled that I became aware that Colin Farrell had the role of Oz, hidden underneath all the prosthetics and make-up. Yes, he was referred to as The Penguin, but it wasn't overdone, and his full name (Oswald Cobblepot) was never mentioned.Rounding out the principals was Zoe Kravitz as the slinky Catwoman, Selina Kyle. She had some major kick butt action in the film, and rose to the occasion to save Batman's near the end of the story. Speaking of which, even with his seemingly armor plated outfit, Batman appeared unusually vulnerable to attacks by his foes in the picture. It marked him as more human than the average super-hero with unusual powers.I will say this, your attention needs to be focused due to the nuances that are revealed in the telling of Bruce Wayne's parents' story and how he might have been misled growing up. His father's relationship with Falcone and fellow mob boss Salvatore Moroni bear on Gotham's reputation. Maybe it was inadvertent, but there might have been a subliminal tribute to the "Gotham" series here with the character of Falcone associate Kenzie (Peter McDonald). The role of James Gordon in that series was portrayed by Ben McKenzie.

Review: I will be honest and say that I had mixed opinions of another Batman movie, especially when I heard of the casting of the lead star of the Twilight films, but as time went by and saw more images and clips, I was more up for it, directed by Matt Reeves (Cloverfield, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes). Basically, on Halloween, Gotham City mayor Don Mitchell Jr. (Rupert Penry-Jones) is murdered by a man calling himself the Riddler. The Batman, aka billionaire Bruce Wayne (Robert Pattinson), has been operating as a masked vigilante for two years, he investigates alongside the Gotham City Police Department. A message is left addressed to The Batman by the Riddler, but Commissioner Pete Savage (EastEnders' Alex Ferns) berates Lieutenant James Gordon (Jeffrey Wright) for allowing a vigilante to enter the crime scene and forces Batman to leave. Soon after, the Riddler kills Savage and leaves another message for Batman. Batman and Gordon discover that the Riddler left a USB drive in Mitchell's car containing images of Mitchell with a woman, Annika Koslov (Hana Hrzic). They were photographed outside the Iceberg Lounge, a nightclub operated by Oswald "Oz" Cobblepot, better known as the Penguin (Colin Farrell), the chief lieutenant of mobster Carmine Falcone (John Turturro). Batman questions the Penguin who claims not to know anything but working at the club as a waitress is Annika's roommate, Selina Kyle (Zoë Kravitz). Batman follows Selina home to question Annika, but she disappears, so he sends Selina back to the Iceberg Lounge to search for answers. With Selina using an eyepiece with a camera face recognition technology, Batman discovers that Savage was on Falcone's payroll, and so is District Attorney Gil Colson (Peter Sarsgaard). Selina takes out the eyepiece, cutting communication with Batman, when he presses her about her relationship with Falcone. The Riddler abducts Colson, strapping a collar bomb and timer to his neck, and sends him to interrupt Mitchell's funeral. When Batman arrives, the Riddler (Paul Dano) video calls him on Colson's phone and threatens to detonate the bomb if Colson cannot answer three riddles. Batman helps Colson answer the first two, but Colson refuses to answer the third, to name the informant who leaked information to the GCPD leading to a historic drug bust ending mobster the operations of mobster Sal Maroni, so the bomb is exploded and Colson dies. Batman and Gordon deduce that the informant may be the Penguin and track him to a drug deal. They discover that Maroni's operation transferred to Falcone, with many GCPD officers involved. Selina inadvertently exposes them when she arrives to steal money. As the Penguin flees, Selina discovers Annika's dead body in a car trunk. After a chase through the city, Batman captures the Penguin but learns that he was not the informant. Batman and Gordon follow the Riddler's trail to the ruins of an orphanage funded by Bruce Wayne's murdered parents, Thomas (Luke Roberts) and Martha (Stella Stocker). There they learn that the Riddler holds a grudge against the Wayne family. Bruce's butler and caretaker, Alfred Pennyworth (Andy Serkis), is hospitalised after opening a letter addressed to Bruce, containing a bomb that explodes. Then the Riddler leaks evidence that Thomas Wayne, who was running for mayor before he was murdered, hired Falcone to kill a journalist for threatening to reveal details about Martha's embarrassing history of mental illness. Bruce, who grew up believing his father was a good man, confronts Alfred, who confirms the allegations but maintains that Thomas only wanted Falcone to threaten the journalist to keep quiet, and planned to turn Falcone over to the police once he found out the journalist was murdered. Alfred believes that Falcone had Thomas and Martha killed to prevent this. Selina tells Batman that Falcone is her father, but Falcone is unaware of this. She learns that Falcone strangled Annika because Mitchell told her that Falcone was the informant and decides to kill him. Batman and Gordon arrive at the Iceberg Lounge in time to stop her, but the Riddler kills Falcone as he is arrested. The Riddler is unmasked as forensic accountant Edward Nashton and incarcerated in Arkham State Hospital (Arkham Asylum). Unaware that Batman is Bruce Wayne, he talks about failing to kill Bruce, who he idolises and took inspiration from when targeting the corrupt. Nashton proposes a partnership, but Batman rejects him. Searching Nashton's apartment, Batman learns that he has planted car bombs around Gotham City and has gained an online following with the goal being to assassinate mayor-elect Bella Reál (Jayme Lawson). They are all detonated and destroy the breakwaters around Gotham, causing the city to flood. A shelter is set up in an indoor arena, where Nashton's followers shoot at Reál. The assassination fails however with Batman and Selina, as Catwoman, fighting them off. In the aftermath, Nashton befriends an unseen Arkham inmate (Barry Keoghan), most likely the Joker, and they laugh together. Meanwhile, Selina deems Gotham beyond saving and leaves. Batman aids recovery efforts and vows to inspire hope in Gotham. Also starring Gil Perez-Abraham as Officer Martinez, Peter McDonald as Kenzie, Con O'Neill as Chief Mackenzie Bock, Oscar Novak as Young Bruce Wayne, Joseph Walker as Young Riddler, Sandra Dickinson as Dory, and Jack Bennett as Travis. Pattison gives a suitably moody and dynamic as the Caped Crusader, with very few scenes of him out of the suit (which is a good thing), Dano is great at being the menacing and maniacal villain, Kravitz does well as the street-savvy cat burglar (hence Catwoman), Farrell is utterly unrecognisable under the prosthetics and gets some one-liners, and there is good support from Wright as the honest cop and Serkis as the hero's mentor. The making and release of the film was delayed a few times by COVID-19, including Pattison catching the virus; it was odd to see it rated 15, but the violence, threat and swearing make it so, and the three-hour length is a bit much, but besides that, it worked out nicely. It is completely different to past Batman movies, with much more emphasis on being like a detective story, you go along with the Hitchcockian style serial killer mystery, following the clues, it has a terrifically dark noirish tone, and there a few explosive pyrotechnical chases and fights to keep fans happy, an intriguing and watchable superhero action thriller. Very good!

Review: We are now on "The Batman." I suppose such a title is to distinguish it from plain ol' "Batman." Like the football players who are from "The" Ohio State University or "The" University of Miami as though there are impostors of those same schools out there that they have to distinguish themselves from.Robert Pattinson plays Batman, and while his Batman is adequate, his Bruce Wayne was underwhelming. His Batman seemed to have fewer gadgets, but he did at least make his suit bulletproof. His Bruce Wayne was barely shown, and when he was it was as if he carried the pain and anger of Batman with him. All other Bruce Wayne's were able to turn on the charm when in public, this Bruce Wayne has the "life sucks" face."The Batman" opted to be more of a murder mystery than an action flick. There was action (even a scene involving the Penguin in which the audience applauded), but nothing like Batmans past.A glasses-wearing masked man was committing a string of murders. He was killing high profile members of Gotham and leaving cyphers for Batman to figure out. The movie doesn't hide that the killer is the Riddler, while it does hide his true identity. The Riddler was circuitously directing Batman and others to a particular criminal he wanted outed. Batman and Lt. James Gordon (Jeffrey Wright) suspected that the Riddler's final target was either The Penguin (Colin Farrell) or Carmine Falcone (John Turturro). Whether or not it's either of them is saved for close to the end.Speaking of the end, this movie was nearly three hours long, and I began to feel it. There was a point that the movie could've wrapped up, and I thought it was, then it dragged on for another half-hour or so. I was happy to be in the theater watching a movie, but not that happy. A two hour movie would've been just as satisfying. After watching all of the previews it made the movie-going experience well over three hours.How does this Batman stack up against the others? OK. It's no "Dark Knight," but it is also far from "Batman Forever" or "Batman & Robin."Free with Cinemark Movie Club membership.

Review: The Riddler(Paul Dano, spot-on. How did it take this long for him to get a role like this?) targets public officials, revealing their corruption, and killing them in gruesome fashion(how did this get away with a PG-13 again? Oh, right, as long as you don't show the details, then you can get away with almost anything, by now. Even a barely toned down Jigsaw). In order to stop him, it will be necessary for the Bat and the Cat(with amazing chemistry), together, to stop the rat. Thanks, Matt.I really did not think that we needed yet another film dealing with Bruce Wayne's alter-ego. How about Nightwing? I know it's not likely, but part of me still holds out hope that Grayson will be turned into a feature(if you've never checked out the trailer on YouTube, you're missing out). But somehow, this managed to convince me. Fingers crossed for at least one sequel. Robert Pattinson is incredible here. Seriously, can we just stop freaking out every time the role is recast? The closest we've come to someone who shouldn't be doing it is George Clooney, and it's not like anybody came out of that flick looking good. He took that job after doing From Dusk till Dawn. There was good reason to think that he was going to be badass. Honestly, everyone here gives a strong performance.Something that will definitely appeal to some more than others, is the genre and tone. This is essentially Se7en meets Zodiac. It is not paced like a typical massive blockbuster. While the action is great, especially the martial arts, not to mention that car chase, there's less of it and it is smaller scale than for example the Nolan trilogy(which also has far more escalation). Essentially, this just isn't focused that much on that aspect of the titular icon. And I think we can all agree that we've had some great entries that deliver that. This is more interested in conveying to the audience that there's a reason he's called the world's greatest detective. We've barely seen it outside of the animated ones before, so I'm very happy with that choice by them.In addition to what I've already mentioned, this features some drugs, suggestive material and strong language. I recommend this to any fan of Batman. 9/10.

We've barely seen it outside of the animated ones before, so I'm very happy with that choice by them.In addition to what I've already mentioned, this features some drugs, suggestive material and strong language. I recommend this to any fan of Batman. 9/10.

Review: Batman helps Lieutenant James Gordon investigate a series of murders of prominent citizens, each of which is accompanied by a cryptic puzzle. Tendrils snake into the underworld and into previously ususpected areas of darkness in Bruce Wayne's personal history.Matt Reeves' 3-hour epic reboot of the caped crusader hits cinema screens, and it is unlike any previous version. In truth, I was ready to dislike it - not because of any great loyalty to any previous iteration, just 'cuz - but it's not bad. It's not great, and it takes itself far too seriously, but it's good.We discover immediately that this Batman is a brutal brawler, but we then find out that he is an able detective, working with quasi-approval from the GCPD. Bruce Wayne is a bit of an emo goth, which didn't quite work for me, but Robert Pattinson is a covincing Batman, brooding and understated. Paul Dano also impressed.I have quibbles. One. My late father used to bemoan the tendency for modern movies to be dark: he would have HATED this. I have never seen such a dark film. Two. The wonderful Michael Giacchino has lifted the musical motif for Batman straight from Darth Vader's theme, which was both naughty and distracting. Three. It is possible to drop in a bit of light relief here and there, y'know. Just a bit. In three hours.Not bad, though.

Review: THE BATMAN (2022) *** Robert Pattinson, Zoe Kravitz, Jeffrey Wright, Colin Farrell, Paul Dano, John Turturro, Andy Serkis, Peter Sarsgaard. Filmmaker Matt Reeves pulls out all the stops in this even darker adaptation of the Bob Kane comic book hero with Pattinson standing tall and brooding as Bruce Wayne employing vigilante style justice as The Caped Cursader while Gotham quakes under the siege of the homicidal Riddler (Dano affectively disturbing) and gaining an unlikely ally in Selina Kyle (ass-kicking Kravitz in pre-Catwoman mode). Arresting visuals thanks in large part to ace cinematography by Greig Fraser and James Chinlund's production design all aided by the foreboding score by Michael Giacchino full of bombast and dread. Farrell, under a ton of unrecognizable prosthetics, has a field day in getting in touch with his inner Robert De Niro as The Penguin. By all means see it in IMAX!

Review: Greetings again from the darkness. Riddle me this: does "The Bat, The Cat, and The Rat" sound more like an opening line to a joke or the title of a Dr. Seuss book? In fact, those are three core elements of this new, COVID-delayed, and highly anticipated film from writer-director Matt Reeves and co-writer Peter Craig. I'll confess to being a huge fan of Christopher Nolan's 'Dark Knight' trilogy (that concluded 10 years ago), and being a bit skeptical to a new version featuring Robert Pattinson in the titular role (I'm choosing to totally ignore the in-between portrayals in the "Justice League" movies). Knowing full well how important it is for fans to watch these films with fresh eyes and a clear head, this review is purposefully vague on what will surely prove to be some of the more popular and contentious discussion points.Let's start with a general description and the setup. The film is dark and gloomy and gritty and grimy. Gotham is a cesspool of corruption and crime, and we get no glimpse into the other side, assuming there is one. Billionaire Bruce Wayne (Robert Pattinson) is still in his second year as the Batman, often referred to as "Vengeance". There is substantial backstory for Mr. Wayne, who lives in relative seclusion with his trusty manservant Alfred Pennyworth (Andy Serkis), while the Batman prowls at night in his efforts to clean up the city. Of course he is unable to keep pace with crime and corruption, even with the close alliance he has built with good cop, Police Lt. James Gordon (Jeffrey Wright). It takes Batman's Poirot-like detective skills to solve a riddle left as a clue in a particularly high-profile murder case. Soon it's obvious a serial killer is at work and he has purposefully drawn the Batman into his game.The caped crusader proceeds to cross paths with Selena Kyle/Catwoman (a terrific Zoe Kravitz), Oswald Cobblepot/Penguin (an unrecognizable Colin Farrell), District Attorney Gil Golson (Peter Sarsgaard), and crime lord Carmine Falcone (John Turturro). As city VIPs begin showing up dead, it's a masked Edward Nashton/Riddler (Paul Dano) who always seems a step ahead. All of the above receive their chance to shine on screen, and while none let us down, it's not until the mask is ripped from Riddler, and Dano really shines, that we are left wanting more. It should be noted that Farrell (with his facial prosthetics and fat suit) is kind of a second fiddle here, but it's surely intentional and meant to set the stage for more Penguin antics down the road.Pattinson will certainly receive the most scrutiny. I found him to be an excellent Batman, with black eye makeup smeared by sweat under his cowl, maintaining the grungy tone. His whispery voice differs from Christian Bale's gravely growl, but works for the character's withdrawn nature and preference for detective work over than fighting. Staying true to the premise that this is only his second year, there is a significant shortage of "wonderful toys", and the batmobile is less rocket ship and more souped-up coupe. The contrast to these is a batsuit that seems quite advanced (and looks cool). It's Pattinson's Bruce Wayne that didn't work for me. I respect the reclusive billionaire aspect, but he mostly looks like someone on their way to a Nirvana gig, leaving us wondering how the heck could anyone not connect the dots between a creepy rich guy and a nearly identical creepy guy in a bat suit. It's a minor complaint, but one that stuck with me.Oscar-winning composer Michael Giacchino (UP, 2009) takes a more classical approach than the dramatics of predecessors Hans Zimmer and Danny Elfman. Giacchino has been a frequent Pixar contributor, and scored some well-known blockbusters in franchises like 'Jurassic World', 'Star Trek', 'Planet of the Apes', 'Mission Impossible', 'Spider-man', and 'Star Wars'. His work fits nicely here. Adapting characters and stories originated by Bob Kane and Bill Finger, Matt Reeves and Peter Craig have found a way to put their own stamp on the work. Mr. Craig is Oscar winner Sally Field's son, and his previous scripts include THE TOWN (2010), parts 1 and 2 of THE HUNGER GAMES: MOCKINGJAY, and upcoming high-profile projects in TOP GUN: MAVERICK and GLADIATOR 2. Director Reeves has previously helmed the excellent horror film LET ME IN (2010), as well as DAWN OF THE PLANET OF THE APES (2014) and WAR FOR THE PLANET OF THE APES (2017).This marks the first in a planned Batman trilogy, and a couple of the last scenes seemingly set the stage for what's to come. Although this is an odd movie, here's hoping the franchise maintains this tone and avoids the typical Marvel/DC overblown CGI approach. After all, the Batman is but one man, not a God of superpowers. This film is an unusual blend of noir-horror-detective-action-psychological thriller wrapped in a gray box with a black bow, and though it will likely be divisive among fans (isn't everything?), this 3-hour epic leaves us anticipating the next 'bat time' and 'bat channel'.Opens wide in theaters on March 4, 2022.

Review: Batman has had lots of movies through the years and he did a bit of detective work, but not much. So this movie obviously wanted to showcase this ability of The Batman and it does so very well having a very good set of villains as this Riddler is much more what I am used to in the comics, the Penguin is not some mutated dude raised by penguins and corruption is the key to everything. We get a new Batman in Robert Pattison and he does a very good job, more dark and brooding and without all the growling and shouting of Bale's. The movie is dark and just very interesting as it truly had me wondering who and what was the endgame. However, there is action, so do not let people try to say that the film is absent of some good old punching!The story, key political figures are being dispatched, first it is the mayor. The person responsible leaves chilling riddles behind and seems to be taking an interest in Batman who is already Batman so no origin story here. Batman is already working with Gordon and looks over the crime scene. Soon things start to point to this person or that and even Bruce's father may have a part in it as the Riddler's game turns out to be even more heinous than even Batman could guess!Pattison was very good as Batman, he was not super muscular like the Batman in the comics, but really the only guy who pumped up for the role was Ben Affleck's Batman. I would put Robert in a tie with Bale in second as they both look fit, but not really jacked up. Colin is great as the Penguin and I was totally surprised to find Andy Serkis was Alfred. I kept thinking I know him from somewhere, but I guess I just did not think of the actor as old enough to be Alfred. Zoe Kravitz is a rather good Catwoman, not quite Michelle's but better than the one from Rising. The Batmobile I rather liked, like the Batmobile fused with Mad Max's vehicle!So, this film was good, I would say it is my fave Batman, but one always tends to fall in love with something when they see it for the first time, so I'll hold judgement. I am very curious to see where this is going and if they team up who I think they are going to team up, that would be really cool. I definitely think Robert can do the job, was not a fan of Twilight, but come on, everyone has to get their start somewhere, and he was so dark in this film, most will forget that he ever sparkled.

Review: Well Rob Pattinson is no Christine Bale and it was smart that Pattinson did a different version for The Batman. There was no Christine Bale the playboy millionaire character side of Batman which made the movie less fun. Regrettably, there was not much humor in The Batman, but The Batman took a much darker serious role! Thankful, that woke Hollywood did not ruin another Super hero movie with forcing the current woke flavor characters, or storyline, which creates another disjointed and boring film. Hollywood did not create another formulated good guy meets bad guy with super power duel ending either. The Batman is sorta anti woke. Themes like everyone is not what people formulate them as. Batman is not the only one with dark secrets. Even the most noble have burred mistakes and pasts. The truth is mixed with lies and what we want to believe. The themes create sub stories which slowly unravel and keep the enthralled in what will be revealed next. The Batman character is built up rage, which turns dark. The Batman/Wayne character and story meld into one, while every character think that they are the true victim and Wayne had it easy. The plot twist, I never saw coming, was the Riddler is just a angry tech guy, very human, delusional, and frail. I will not call this the best Batman, but compared to todays trash superhero movie The Batman is a solid movie. 8 stars.

Review: Always been a "Batman" fan as the D. C. legend is my favorite superhero and watching all of the movies from the classic 1989 one, every so often the fans see that the series changes tone and feel as it's rebooted. "The Batman" directed by Matt Reeves is a dark take with conflict as "Batman" deals with a city underworld of secrets, while serial killings are happening, and the hope and chance for romance struts right in front of him.Gotham has a serial killer on the loose and with each victim found strange puzzle like word clues are left, as "Batman" investigates the mystery and things become complex as it's all tied into a world of city officials and underworld crime figures are connected to them. Plus secrets come up as "Batman" himself is wrapped up into this wicked game.The film chemistry and cast of characters are top notch with young star Robert Pattinson filling out the bat suit just fine and Zoe Kravitz is raw and outspoken as Selina Kyle a slash friend and foe love interest of the bat. Colin Farrell was well made up as the Penguin thru it all combined with fire blazing action and kick butt punches "The Batman" is a compelling drama with suspense and revealing secrets of Gotham city officials as crime boss Carmine Falcone is a lead figure to all of this."The Batman" is in depth and dark a new reboot style take on the D. C legend as it's a good film still not the best, still if a "Batman" and D. C. fan you will enjoy as the film rubs off a feel from many of the graphic novels, as to get more understanding read "The Dark Knight Returns" or "The Long Halloween".

Review: "It's a big city. I can't be everywhere." Batman (Rob Pattison) A more complete adaptation of the Batman comics presence there isn't, and no more gothic, spot-on condemnation of human frailty since the 50-year-old Godfather. Writer/director Matt Reeves' The Batman is arguably the definitive dark night of the American soul in its corruption and its salvation. As an achievement of robust American neo noir, it ranks somewhere behind Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver and Godfather.Batman (Rob Pattinson) scowls as if he came from a Twilight frame of mind while he shows a soft side in his love for Selena Kyle/Cat Woman (Zoe Kravitz), the Bat and the Cat, working to save the city from the likes of Riddler (Paul Dano), Penguin (Colin Farrell), and crime lord Carmine Falcone (John Turturro). Besides offing a large number of corrupt city employees, they offer Bruce Wayne a chance to learn about his obsession with his parents' public and private lives and their untimely deaths. Although none of the bad boys eclipses the impact of Heath Ledger's multidimensional Joker, even in his humor, together they are a powerful cast of darkness.Besides bringing together an ensemble of estimable actors in every role, Reeves gathers expert cinematographer Greig Fraser and production designer James Chinlund to create a darkness full of telling images while competing with the great film noir compositions of all time. Dark, yes, obscure, no. The darkness that envelopes each scene says more about the bleak side of humanity than any written treatise could.Besides the corruption of city officials, The Batman casts a shadow over the virtue of vengeance, embodied in Wayne's longing to account for the death of his parents and bad-boys like Riddler to assuage the pain of his childhood by terrorizing the city. In his favor, Riddler is ridding the city of corrupt power while Batman is cleaning it of its petty criminals. His stalwart ally, Lt. James Gordon (Jeffrey Wright), realizes that the real crimes are housed in his police force and ultimately his supervisors.The Batman is a hip and incisive representation of modern angst that not even a hero can relieve, at least not right now:To the strains of Nirvana's baleful Something In The Way: "They think I'm hiding in the shadows, but I AM the shadows."

Review: The headline can be taken two ways. If you remove any hype or expectations, saying it's a good movie is positive. But if you are hoping for an amazing new Batman iteration, good means it wasn't great, let alone amazing.This review will come off as negative but I did enjoy it. I love the tone. It's super dark and grounded in reality, even more than the Nolan trilogy. And it feels true to the character. Zoe Kravitz and Jeffrey Wright are great casting choices. It's a mostly well-made film and a good addition to the franchise. And the Bat suit looks awesome.At the same time, nothing about this movie wowed me. I did not connect with the characters, especially the villain. The relationships seem undeveloped and not organic. I was not nearly as emotionally invested in the story as I should have been. It mostly feels surface level.If you're a huge Batman fan, I think you will really enjoy it. But as a movie, I don't think it fires on all cylinders. The Nolan trilogy still reigns supreme.

Review: The headline can be taken two ways. If you remove any hype or expectations, saying it's a good movie is positive. But if you are hoping for an amazing new Batman iteration, good means it wasn't great, let alone amazing.This review will come off as negative but I did enjoy it. I love the tone. It's super dark and grounded in reality, even more than the Nolan trilogy. And it feels true to the character. Zoe Kravitz and Jeffrey Wright are great casting choices. It's a mostly well-made film and a good addition to the franchise. And the Bat suit looks awesome.At the same time, nothing about this movie wowed me. I did not connect with the characters, especially the villain. The relationships seem undeveloped and not organic. I was not nearly as emotionally invested in the story as I should have been. It mostly feels surface level.If you're a huge Batman fan, I think you will really enjoy it. But as a movie, I don't think it fires on all cylinders. The Nolan trilogy still reigns supreme.

Review: Thank goodness this was good. I made my top ten Batman movies list yesterday and realized I've only seen 10 Batman-starring films so that means...Batman & Robin made the cut. Should that EVER be in a top ten?And yes, The Batman was good. Great, nope but a solid movie that's 90% detective and 10% action. I will say this new Batman-look IS great as is the soundtrack and the amount of actual Batman in the film vs. Just Bruce Wayne. But, no. Robert Pattinson still CANNOT act to save his life. Thanks to Val Kilmer and George Clooney, he's certainly not the worst Bruce/Batman.I can see why this movie's 3-hours long, though 30+ minutes could've EASILY been cut to make this much tighter and a better repeat-watchability. Because, as of now, I really don't ever plan on seeing this again and I even saw Batman & Robin a few times.It's 3-hours long because of the most complicated plot and since they made Bats SOOO much more human in this incarnation, it REALLY takes Batman a VERY long time to figure out the mystery. I will give another praise for how many mistakes he makes and how he's learning. I did like that, but still would've preferred him getting to the core of the plot a lot quicker.It's Batman: Year Two and he's dealing with an incredibly smart villain while working with another vengeance-seeking ally and while he's jumping through one hoop after another, more and more chaos is escalating.Really don't have much negative to say about this other than the length and how both the villain and Bruce are really not that interesting. Luckily, and as stated above, Robert's in the Batsuit for a grand majority of the movie and I really dug that. He looked GREAT as the Bat and while the movie's pretty dark (like way too dark, despite the theme,) they really did make good use of his silhouette and surroundings.I will give kudos to Zoë Kravitz. She was absolutely the best actor in the movie and best character to boot. Where was she when they previously hired Halle Berry?If you choose to see this in theatres, make sure you see it with Dolby surround sound as that was awesome in this. And once I found out there isn't actual end credit and found out what's posted at the end, I left during the credits.I. E. Once the credits roll in the end, just leave. You've already sacrificed 3 hours, save some time left at the end that's not worth your time. Just Google it to learn the "secret" message.***Final Thoughts: Here's the updated Best Batman Movies (that I've seen):1. Batman 2. The Dark Knight 3. Batman Returns 4. Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (Ultimate Edition) 5. Batman Begins 6. The Lego Batman Movie 7. The Batman 8. Batman: Mask of the Phantasm 9. The Dark Knight Rises 10. Batman Forever.

Review: The Batman creates a grim & gloomy atmosphere, and it moves along so slowly that you could almost fall asleep to it. However, if you did, you'd probably have nightmares. This movie made me believe that Robert Pattison could be Batman, although I'm not entirely sold on him as Bruce Wayne. Paul Dano is disturbingly demented in his role as the Riddler, and Colin Farrell is absolutely unrecognizable as the Penguin. I liked this new take on Batman, but I didn't love it.

Review: I liked the movie. There were some ridiculous scenes in the movie, but overall I liked the movie. I watched the movie in Baku (Azerbaijan) 28 Mall, Cinema Plus and the movie theater was good. There was no problem on screen, light and sound. The movie was long, it could have been a little short because the endings of the movie were a bit boring. Music and specially the main score was good. The acting was great, Robert Pattison, Zoe Kravitz, Paul Dano, Colin Farrell, Jeffrey Wright, John Turturo all did well. I was happy when I heard that Robert Pattion will be the Batman, because he is such a good actor. Please forget about the "vampire" thing. Matt Reeves did a great job. Gotham City was great. Bruce Wayne turned out to be exactly what I wanted.I really liked this movie.I did not like Alfred.In my opinion Best Batman, not best Bruce Wayne, not Best Batman movie but overall very good movie.

Review: Greetings from Lithuania."The Batman" (2022) for me personally was not as entertaining as Christopher Nolan's take in "The Dark Knight" trilogy. If i would compare this movie to Nolan's series, it would be more close to "The Dark Knight". That said i liked "The Batman" for its being very faithful adaptation of Batman universe itself. I saw two or three DC' animated Batman movies and this film was more in common with those then any other Batman movie ever made."The Batman" (2022) is a very dark movie, and i mean that in every way. In a whole 3 hours running time there is basically scene or two set in day time. And 98% of the film is set during night, and looks like in Gotham it is always raining. It is a very gritty and down to earth setting, and that i liked about it. The atmosphere of this movie highly reminded me of "Se7en" (1995). Performances were good and Robert Pattinson was a superb as Batman. Yet i think it was Zoë Kravitz who stole the show.Overall, "The Batman" (2022) is a dark, gritty and very down to earth adaptation of Batman. For younger audiences who grew up on watching Marvel movies (no offence - i really enjoy them as well) this adaptation of Batman will be a test of patience - this movie is not for everyone and reminded me of "Joker" (2019) more then any other comic book movie. In its running time 3 hours this movie did drag here and there, but as a whole package it really worth seeing. Not my favorite Batman movie, but a solid one.

Review: "The Batman" is an Action - Drama movie in which we watch Batman trying to protect the citizens of Gotham from the Riddler, a sadistic serial killer who murders some politicians of the city.I have to admit that I did not have high expectations from this movie but I happily surprised by it. It was different than the previous Batman movies, a bit darker and the action scenes were also captured from a different aspect. The plot of the movie was interesting and contained plenty of suspense but it also contained some very slow scenes that they could be sorter. The interpretation of Robert Pattinson who played as Bruce Wayne was good and he made the difference. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Zoë Kravitz's who played as Selina Kyle, Jeffrey Wright's who played as Lt. James Gordon, Andy Serkis' who played as Alfred and Paul Dano's who played as The Riddler. Finally, I have to say that "The Batman" is a nice action movie and I highly recommend everyone to watch it.

Review: The Batman (2022) is a movie my wife and I caught an advanced screening of last night. The storyline follows Gotham shortly after "The Batman" has emerged and established himself in the streets. A serial killer known as The Riddler starts a killing spree of everyone influential within Gotham's hierarchy until Bruce Wayne in inevitably the target. How are all of these people tied together and can Batman tie the pieces together before Wayne is the next victim?This movie is directed by Matt Reeves (Cloverfield) and stars Robert Pattinson (Twilight), Zoë Kravitz (Kimi), Colin Farrell (Total Recall), Paul Dano (There Will be Blood), John Turturro (Do the Right Thing), Peter Sarsgaard (Garden State), Andy Serkis (Lord of the Rings), Jeffrey Wright (Shaft) and Barry Keoghan (Eternals).The storyline, look and feel of this movie is an A+. The characters are perfectly cast and well executed. Farrell, Dano and Kravitz were a 10/10.This movie does a fantastic job of depicting the Batman universe with the appropriate grit and feel and the lighting and cinematography is excellent. This also did a good job of creating various potential spinoffs with some subtle references within the storyline and at the end. This has a very good Jeph Loeb comics feel to it and does a good job delivering the "Detective" elements of Batman. The violence was also brilliant and very well done. I will say this did not need to be 3-hours and there are an abundance of scenes that could have been better edited. This film likely should have been a hair under 2 and a half hours.Overall this is a magnificent addition to the super hero genre and an absolute must see for Batman fans. I would score this a 7.5- 8/10 and strongly recommend it.

Review: The darkest Batman adaptation even the first one with a f bomb! Beautifully filmed with the amazing writing and oh man Paul Dano was masterful as Riddler and I think Robert Pattinson was one of the best Batman's! Only minor thing to budge through is the length even that was worth it all the through especially the IMAX format made everything better.I was a little annoyed someone got their seat late and wanted me and my sister to move down even though I had my ticket for a few weeks that was ridiculous they were lucky I didn't feel like saying much cause I'm to nice for my own good; not only that stuff a family thought Ben Affleck's Batman was better hell to the no! Anyway I love how ratings are close to Dark Knight, The Batman deserves so much praise.

Review: I just got out of The BatmanThis movie really won't be for everyone!! Easily the darkest Batman movie yet. It is gritty, depressing and not a fun movie at all.This isn't your usual comic book movie, it's a detective movie, with more in common with Se7en, than previous Batman movies. The first two thirds of the movie are amazing, at one point I turned to my son and said "This is a masterpiece" everything works and is brilliant, I was 100% enthralled, but boy does it drop the ball in the final act.Of the cast Pattinson is great, Collin Farrell is ok, Zoe Kravitz was fine too, but she has zero chemistry with Pattinson (Keaton and Pfeiffer they are not), Paul Dano though, was incredible, especially in the scene in Arkham, whilst Geoffrey Wright is as great as he always is.On the downside, It does have some pacing issues, and is really too long (though I'm not sure what I'd cut), and I really wasn't keen on the ending (I don't know if it is a comic book storyline they did), as I think the final act really lets the movie down!! It's here, in the final act, that you feel the movies run time!!I was surprised there were only 36 other people in my screening.

Review: So nice to see that it is still possible to make a blockbuster action movie that really has got COJONES.The good: the acting performances are TOP. They really are. And acting is what matters firstmost. The many different characters are true to life, however weird this story might be, I still DO BELIEVE in these characters. They come to life before my eyes and they splash of the screen. NICE.More good: this movie has got an EDGE. It's dark, it's violent. Like it suppose to be. Direction, soundtrack, photography, editing. Every technical detail is TOP NOTCH. What a joy for my eyes.Not any good? Lasting a whopping 2 hours and 45 minutes is stretching it, but this is one of those FEW action movies in which it could have lasted another hour and I still would have been GLUED to the screen.Bravo! They nailed it with this version. Recommended? YES. Spread the word....

Review: 5 out of 5 stars.The Batman is an electrifying dark superhero film and dives into an psychological crime story. Director Matt Reeves takes this film into a whole new dark direction. So dark that every scene seems faded or taking place in a night raining setting. The script and narration in the beginning sets the tone of the film. With Bruce Wayne giving a narrative about how he brings fear that every criminal stays away from the shadows. The film is one awesome superhero film. Watching it the first time may not be enough with so much to digest on what is going on with the depth layer of the story. For a 3 hour run time, the film packs so much that it never once felt long.The script and direction is great. Dark atmospheric setting. Showing Gotham a city that is on a ticking time bomb with crime happening. Nirvana's song playing a couple of times setting that mood of the film. Which is dark and setting that depressing mood. But it works great. The action sequences are great. The fight scenes are well choregraphed. The villains Riddler played by Paul Dano is great. Riddler played more like a zodiac killer. The direction plays like a crime solving film with Batman being detective and on the trail of the riddler. Leading Batman investigating criminal syndicates like Falcone (John Turturro) and Penguin (Colin Farrell). And catwoman (Zoe Kravitz) assisting him with the investigation. The film gritty and grounded with its action sequences. The car chase was awesome with the cinematography being close to the action as possible.Robert Pattinson is great as a dark version of Bruce Wayne. And great as Batman. Paul Dano is good. John Turturro, Colin Farrell, Zoe Kravitz, Andy Serkis, and Jeffrey Wright were all great with there roles.The cinematography and music score were great. The film does have one brief scene that hints towards another film. The film has a deep depth story that packs a lot and ties a lot together. It is one awesome film that will leave a lot talking about.

Review: RRR (2022) : Movie Review -High and Low. No, I'm not talking about Akira Kurosawa's Japanese flick from 1963, but I'm talking about SS Rajamouli's RRR. Actually, that's the best brief for the film I can think of. SS Rajamouli has been making mass-friendly commercial films for a long time, but Bahubali brought him pan-India popularity. He became a household name and a BRAND! So naturally, anything he would do after Bahubali was meant to look smaller or look comparatively less because the bar was set too high for any filmmaker and for himself too. The same happened with Prabhas when he came after Bahubali with "Saaho" and "Radhe Shyam". Let's just accept the fact that a film like "Bahubali : The Conclusion" (2017) can't be made again and again. Not just because it was a Massive Blockbuster, but also because the kind of extraordinary commercial cinema it presents is almost impossible nowadays. When I saw Bahubali 2, I called it the Greatest Commercial Entertainer of this millennium after Gadar (2001). Surprisingly, these two films are the only ones in this century to sell 5 crore+ tickets in the Hindi belt. It was acceptable to see such heroic characters in Bahubali because the film is set in an ancient period, which makes it reasonable. But with RRR, it can't be held reasonable enough because the film is set in the 20th century, where you expect some humanly possible stuff. It doesn't matter how big (fictionally) your character is, it has to make some sense when it comes to on-screen persona, as we have had so many legendary personalities during this period, who have served the nation till the last drop of their blood, and it all came with human restrictions. RRR looks problematic in that sense, but if you talk about mass cinema, then RRR is simply phenomenal.RRR is a fictional tale set in the 1920s. Two Indian revolutionaries, Rama Raju (Ram Charan) and Komaram Bheem (Jr. NTR), try to fight the mighty British Empire and Nizam of Hyderabad in their own ways, which are interestingly opposite and unknown to each other. Bheem is after a little girl who has been abducted by British officer Steve (Ray Stevenson) and his wife, Lady Scott (Alison Doody), while Rama is a British cop who tries to stop him. Two powerful heroes, one fiRe and one wateR, are pitted against each other, and then you get to know about their agendas in the second half when the story unfolds the past events.RRR presents Ram Charan and Jr. NTR in never-seen-before avatars. Rajamouli makes sure that their crazy mass fan following gets enough content to have a big mass party in the cinema halls. Ram Charan enters with a 5-minute long action scene, which does look a little too extraordinary for an ordinary mind, but that's what "mass cinema" means, right? On the other hand, Jr. NTR has got a crazy mass entry that has a class too. That entire forest sequence will blow your mind. A good happy warning to all Tarak fans: please keep your expectations high because Bheem is going to exceed all of them. The pair of Rama and Bheem work like a fireworks display during all those large-scale action sequences. Talking about the supporting cast, especially two Hindi actors, Ajay Devgn and Alia Bhatt, both have small but important cameos. Ajay Devgn does the speaking with his intense eyes again, and in other news, the sky is blue. This man has some charisma of his own. It's only a matter of a genius filmmaker who can use it correctly. Alia Bhatt as Sita looks gorgeous in every single scene, and her character plays a vital part in the narrative. Olivia Morris sparkles the screen with her beauty, and her accent is too cute. Alison Doody is the exact opposite of that, but that's what the villainous characters do. Both Samuthirakani and Shriya Saran appear in small roles, and both pass with good grades.RRR's basic script is as good as any Telugu action drama (mind you, some call it mindless), but the screenplay doesn't match that certain level you are expecting. The second half may bore you with outdated melodrama and may cause a little irritation too. All those flaws will be forgiven when you witness the Big-screen extravaganza in 3D. The action sequences of RRR have set the benchmark for all the filmmakers in India. Rajamouli outperforms himself from wherever he has done Bahubali. That film still had battlefield references to help a bit, but RRR, despite being driven by two characters, provides a better visual spectacle than Bahubali. That's not a small thing, mind you. The music of RRR is going to create some hysteria in theatres. If you don't feel like dancing while "Naacho Naacho," I'd say please consult a doctor. You are not normal. "Dosti" has got nice tunes for a situational song, and "Komuram Bheemudo" will take you all by surprise. I'm not sure if you can hear "Raamam Raaghavam" clearly because there will be a lot of noise, including big screams and whistles, going around at the time. But you'll ask for a repeat viewing after reaching home.It's been more than two years since we haven't had a big pan-India event film and SS Rajamouli brings back that much needed "Big-Screen Experience" for us. Undoubtedly, the best director in India when it comes to commercial cinema. The name is SS Rajamouli! His extraordinary vision of looking at ordinary things is what makes him better than other filmmakers in India. Bahubali was an ordinary script, but it's Rajamouli who made it an extraordinary film. No matter how many resemblances you find between it and "The Lion King" or its original source material, Shakespeare's Hamlet, it's a story every Indian can relate to. That's the same case with RRR, despite some flaws in the writing. But that's where Rajamouli's genius mind works overtime. He presents the high-octane mass hysteria that is sure to make the masses go crazy. The hardcore patriotism will please a certain section too. Whether it be the introduction scenes of the two lead actors or that train bridge action scene or that pre-interval rampage or even that mind-boggling climax in the forest, SS Rajamouli has outdone himself. He has reached a level that other commercial directors in Indian cinema can never reach or even dream about. Give this man a weak script and he will still make a strong mass entertainer out of it. That's what he has done with RRR. Every single viewer is going to hail him for his superlative vision of how to look at period action dramas. Every filmmaker who wants to make a great mass film should learn from him. As a whole, RRR packs a solid punch of out-and-out commercial entertainer that we have been missing since the Bahubali juggernaut. Just don't mind the below average writing, and you are going to LOVE IT!RATING - 6/10*

Review: RRR (2022) : Movie Review -High and Low. No, I'm not talking about Akira Kurosawa's Japanese flick from 1963, but I'm talking about SS Rajamouli's RRR. Actually, that's the best brief for the film I can think of. SS Rajamouli has been making mass-friendly commercial films for a long time, but Bahubali brought him pan-India popularity. He became a household name and a BRAND! So naturally, anything he would do after Bahubali was meant to look smaller or look comparatively less because the bar was set too high for any filmmaker and for himself too. The same happened with Prabhas when he came after Bahubali with "Saaho" and "Radhe Shyam". Let's just accept the fact that a film like "Bahubali : The Conclusion" (2017) can't be made again and again. Not just because it was a Massive Blockbuster, but also because the kind of extraordinary commercial cinema it presents is almost impossible nowadays. When I saw Bahubali 2, I called it the Greatest Commercial Entertainer of this millennium after Gadar (2001). Surprisingly, these two films are the only ones in this century to sell 5 crore+ tickets in the Hindi belt. It was acceptable to see such heroic characters in Bahubali because the film is set in an ancient period, which makes it reasonable. But with RRR, it can't be held reasonable enough because the film is set in the 20th century, where you expect some humanly possible stuff. It doesn't matter how big (fictionally) your character is, it has to make some sense when it comes to on-screen persona, as we have had so many legendary personalities during this period, who have served the nation till the last drop of their blood, and it all came with human restrictions. RRR looks problematic in that sense, but if you talk about mass cinema, then RRR is simply phenomenal.RRR is a fictional tale set in the 1920s. Two Indian revolutionaries, Rama Raju (Ram Charan) and Komaram Bheem (Jr. NTR), try to fight the mighty British Empire and Nizam of Hyderabad in their own ways, which are interestingly opposite and unknown to each other.

Review: RATED 10/10 Language: Telugu Media Partner: Zee5 Source: Nil HIGHLY RECOMMENDEDMovie starts with two hero introductions, that itself like full meals satisfaction...Really the trailer shown the 30% of the movie it has much more action blocks and goosebumps moments in the movie... its real double treat and mass moments also doubled with dual heroes... Naattu song is the cherry on top, whole theatre goes mad on this one... the interval block action sequence is real jaw dropping one, even though we can guess this one, but cant guess the scale...Second half starts with bit slow flashback, but it picks up to the paek immediately. Second half has more sentiments and more screen space for RC. RC outshines NTR in lot of places... All the action blocks are gravity defying but enjoyable.... After credit Janta song has cameo from Rajamouli. When the movie ends it was like completing the festival celebration....Exceeding expectations in all aspects....

Review: The last time director SS Rajamouli managed to wow the audience was in 2017 with the film Baahubali: The Conclusion. It took him five long years for him to conceptualise his next film RRR, shoot and bring it to the silver screen. Pulling off a multi-starrer with Jr NTR and Ram Charan in the lead roles might seem an accomplishment in itself. But Rajamouli manages to deliver even when it comes to the story.RRR runs on a relatively simple premise. There's 'fire' - an angry, young police officer Ramaraju (Ram Charan) who is both revered and feared by the British. He has done their every bidding for years, he is the one they sic on anyone they want to capture and yet, he is the one who's never given enough respect due to the colour of his skin. Then there's 'water' - sweet, simple, innocent Bheem (Jr NTR) who has brute strength but uses it only when it serves his purpose. He's a Gond tribal who has come to the city to rescue a young girl called Malli, who was taken away by Lady Scott (Alison Doody), to be the singing doll 'on (her) mantelpiece'. But that is just the beginning of the tale.Rajamouli's new calling cards seem to be building new world. Because, despite being based on two revolutionaries from history, RRR has a story that's completely fictional. Delhi of the 1920s becomes his new canvas. Bheem might have fought against the Nizams, so much so that one of them finds it imperative to warn the British that he's not to be taken lightly. But he also finds shelter with Muslims in Delhi. Ramaraju might seem like a well-trained soldier who will follow instructions blindly but he also seems to have a past no one but his uncle (Samuthirakani) knows about. Scott (Ray Stevenson) might believe 'brown rubbish' deserve even a bullet to be wasted on them but Jennifer (Olivia Morris) seems more empathetic. This is not the freedom movement where you turn the other cheek, this is the one where you use your hands as weapons.The first half of RRR runs like clockwork. There's the emotional core in Malli, there's the song and dance with Naatu Naatu (it'll make you smile) and a friendship explored through Dosti, there's even a few laughs whenever Bheem tries to befriend Jennifer. Cinematic liberties are taken but they don't seem as noticable as in the later portions, half where the film falters a bit. Some scenes seem to drag frustratingly because we already know something a core character doesn't. The way Ramaraju's fiancé Sita (Alia Bhatt) is woven into the narrative, apart from Ram Charan's transformation to another look also seem forced in a tale that was smooth sailing. After the way Bheem is set up effortlessly despite nothing much being told, the way Ramaraju's story unfolds seems strained. The climax leaves more to be desired. The good thing however is that the film manages to surprise you. Rajamouli also manages to use certain tropes set up in the initial portions of the film in the latter portions cleverly.None-the-less Rajamouli manages to pull off something people have been pining for - a commercial, action drama that will keep you thoroughly entertained - which it does. The length also doesn't prove to be a hindrance, thanks to a tight screenplay. The VFX in certain portions could've been better. Jr NTR pulls off his career's best performance. He's charming as Bheem, especially in the emotional bits and his desperation to find Malli comes through well, so does his love for Ramaraju. Ram Charan also does well, pouring soul into the transformations his character goes through. Tarak and Charan's roles require them to have chemistry, which they do. Alia Bhatt, Olivia Morris, Samuthirakani, Ajay Devgn, Shriya Saran and others play their parts well. Olivia in particular manages to win your heart. Alison and Ray breeze through their roles. Keeravani's OST for the film might not be for everyone but he does well with the BGM. Senthil's camerawork is a delight too.RRR is not perfection by any means because after the way Rajamouli pulls off certain scenes, you wonder if he could've done a better job in others. But watch this one this weekend if you've been longing for a good action packed drama. Especially so if you're a fan of the lead duo.

Review: I'm not a native Telugu speaking audience so the first time i was exposed to ss rajamouli was when i saw eega that movie also i watched because i heard that ajay devgan was dubbing for the film from that day to this day you can say I'm a fanboy.RRR bleeds ss rajamouli in every frame from the action to dance to the most mundain dilogue it has what i call rajamouli pitch to the film. The filmis three hours long but it never feel like it,the editing and cinematography is awesome the only bad thing about the film is the songs are not as good as his favourite filmsThe film is casted perfectly Ram Charan has played his most wonderful character, NTR has restraint yet powerful presence to the film Alia Bhatt is graceful. All the foreign actors are well casted special mention to the Olivia moris. Ajay Devgan is awesome even in a limited screen presence i would be tempted to say he outperormed both the heros of the Film.The best thing about the film though is the action choreography and it was expected to be good but that have surpassed my expectations same goes with visual effects.The action set peieces were meticulously planned and perfectly excuted.The film will leave you with a wow and it will touch your heart one way or another.one of the most wonderful films i have seen in past few years.

Review: The greatest achievement is not making an industry defining franchise but to give the right follow up to it. Expectations are higher, challenges are higher and the chances of a misfire is at its highest. Visionary directors like Spielberg and James Cameron have proven it on the biggest stage but in Asian cinema, Rajamouli has established himself as the master of making magnum opus movies.The Bahubaali films aside from being box office behemoths, helped Telugu film industry to be popular across the country. Naturally, RRR is expected to reach that benchmark and it does largely to the fantastic lead performances from Ram Charan and Junior NTR. After multiple delays due to the pandemic, RRR hit screens at the right moment without compromising the post production work to hit the screens quickly.On a technical scale, it outdoes Bahubaali considerably. Even the unrealistic action sequences exhilirate you so well that you forget about the logic going out of the window. The criticisms of RRR is it's lack of screentime and proper writing for it's female characters. Like all Indian films it has the troupe of a damsel waiting to be rescued by our macho hero. While Junior NTR and Ram Charan play compelling leads it's tough not to wonder if they were playing The Hulk and Thor, considering they are unfazed by wild animals and bullet injuries.Ultimately RRR is a well made semi-fictional historical drama with the right amount "mass" movements to satisfy the audience. Rajamouli has clearly done his homework and has shown us again why he is the most consistent director in Telugu cinema.

Review: A story about 2 individuals and their respective missions. Its has nothing to do with the India's independence and all....Alluri Sitarama Raju and Komaram Bheema played by Ram Charan and Junior NTR had done an amazing performance. They just toiled for this movie...Visual Effects, Action Stunts, BGM was the highlighting factor as we focus only on story line it will be a disaster as these commercial elements is required to make the audience watch for 3hrs...Breath taking action sequences during the Hero's introduction, interval and at climax which we should definitely expect from a Rajamouli Film...Sabu Cyril production design was fantastic as he able to met the expectations of the director.Alia Bhat failed to impress whereas Ajay Devgn done his cameo performance very well...RRR is all of mass movie with high octane action sequences...The cinematography especially was fabulous as an it just able to say us "Whoaaa"Nattu Nattu song was just awesome as we could see the fast pace Junior NTR and Ram Charan doing their steps and that too with a proper coordination which just have to be experienced over a big screen..Overall its a visual impact treat which at PVR big screen or at Dolby Atmos can be watched.. That kind of efforts the team had put...So RRR a mass entertainer visual impact movie.

They just toiled for this movie...Visual Effects, Action Stunts, BGM was the highlighting factor as we focus only on story line it will be a disaster as these commercial elements is required to make the audience watch for 3hrs...Breath taking action sequences during the Hero's introduction, interval and at climax which we should definitely expect from a Rajamouli Film...Sabu Cyril production design was fantastic as he able to met the expectations of the director.Alia Bhat failed to impress whereas Ajay Devgn done his cameo performance very well...RRR is all of mass movie with high octane action sequences...The cinematography especially was fabulous as an it just able to say us "Whoaaa"Nattu Nattu song was just awesome as we could see the fast pace Junior NTR and Ram Charan doing their steps and that too with a proper coordination which just have to be experienced over a big screen..Overall its a visual impact treat which at PVR big screen or at Dolby Atmos can be watched.. That kind of efforts the team had put...So RRR a mass entertainer visual impact movie.

Review: Both the main leads are super heros who can do anything with their super powers. It gets repeating, repeating throughout the movie. From the beginning the movie is just about the super heros. Ajay and alia are just cameo roles for hindi audience.

Review: Overall, RRR is probably Rajamouli career best since Bahubali frainchase. While it also became NTR and Ram Charan best film since Magadheera, Rangasthalam and Aravinda Sametha Veera Raghava.Music is excellent and direction is great. Sure I think RRR going to set opening record.Definitely a must watch.

Review: This time Rajamouli missed to make an ordinary story into an extraordinary one . Story was good for a commercial movie . First movie started with terrific intro of Ram and Bheem , each of them intro was very well elevated . First half was really good and interesting , all the commercial elements were very well balanced . Second half was quite boring , and some of the over the top scenes really made it an average one . Both Ram Charan and Jr. NTR gave excellent performance . Ajay Devgn had less screentime , but done his part well. Execepted more screentime for Alia . Technically strong movie . Comparing to our Indian standard , VFX were really topnotch . Action sequence were well choreographed . Mind blowing music and songs . Cinematography was good . Kindly avoid 3D Version , it was really pathetic . Overall worth for money and time , it could've been excellent commercial movie if Second half was well concentrated . A good weekend watch with your family .WARNING : AVOID 3D VERSION.

Review: RRR- Old wine in a grandeur, expensive bottle.It is a culmination of friendship, betrayal, patriotism, feeling beyond pain, unimaginable choreography, breathtaking screenplay, unwavering mission, impactful action sequences and astounding background music.Rajamouli does connect the audience with the right emotions and takes us back to the painful history.Ram Charan has outdone himself and enacted well. Ajay Devgan's cameo is crucial for the entire storyline.The shiny part is the Jr NTR who plays a Himalayan role, starts as a feather like character, later erupts as a volcano with powerful dialogue delivery and leads to a solidifying rock.The movie is packed with periodic action drama and it almost does fill the Heart. Watch it in IMAX.It will ROAR in many occasions, portrays REVOLT at the right moments and the flag will RISE high when FIRE meets WATER.

Review: This movie is another commercial mass picture with Rajamouli's touch. The movie lacks strong storyline. The team escapes with the decent screenplay. The actors performance was very good. For world cinema lovers please leave your brain at your home and watch the movie once. This movie is not for us.

Review: The hype for this movie was unreal. But it ended up being just ok-ish, at best. If you dont know anything about the actors playing the heroes in the movie, like me, you will get bored at many points. This movie could be a great treat for mad fans of those celebrities, but the same doesn't hold for non-Telugu audience.Coming to the making, the thing that bothered me the most was CGI. For the budget, I was expecting much better CGI than Bahubali, but it was just as bad. BB was first such big movie, so the poor CGI was ignored by most. But here, the makers have no excuse as they have spent a ton of money and it has been nearly 6-7 years since BB, so technology has advanced as well. Even a simple fort, crowds, or some bird-view shots of the ground look cheesy. Possibly, the makers spent all the money on marketing and forgot about the product.Overall, it's an average movie. Dont buy the hype, keep your expectations low, and you wont be disappointed.

Review: First of all really good, mature acting by NTR jr. And Ram Charan. The scenes they are together, the bromance between them helped add a soul to the movie.The production value made it very enjoyable to watch. The close up shots, the well made CGI all took this movie up some notches.Though the first half was good (like action was pretty crazy like unbelievable and insane but still good), the second half was a bit lackluster in the way they just simply go on an anti British fetish. The commercial elements was seen everywhere but I guess that was intentional for mass audiences.It was great to experience it in 3D. Watch it in 3D if you have the chance.

Review: Now some audiences going to find logic, bcoz its clear when a good film release some ppl are looking for minus point only.For me it is the second true event film that i liked after 13 Hours. These days everyone doing based on someone life but from my side i have got only 3 hour to entertain myself and I can't regret for what i wasting my time. At this topic i only choose to entertain myself except to watch someone struggle in his/her time. I respect them all but i like to read a book about them not in film.Coming to the topic director did a brilliant job again and prove that he is the legend of indian cinema. Now some ppl will find logic, physic etc... Bcoz they don't know how to entertain themselves. Mostly from hindi audiences, by the way i m also a hindi but i like to praise someone hard work and any good films which entertain me anyway.
